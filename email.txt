I am researching ancestors who were born in Staten Island in the 1850's, and I see that any records that might still exist from that time have not yet been digitized according to this website. I am unable to travel to NY and am wondering what other options I might have for this? Can I pay a fee for this information? (I am just looking for the information and not necessarily official birth certificates, unless of course ordering a certificate is the easiest avenue to get that data.)

I am looking for the exact birth dates of these siblings, especially Mary Emily Mills (1858):
    Jonas E. Mills, born 1852, Staten Island, NY, died 14 October 1885, Brookton NY.
    Horace F. Mills, born 1854, Staten Island, NY, died 27 October 1876, Corfu NY.
    Mary Emily Mills, born Dec 1858 Staten Island, NY, died 03 Nov 1937 Brooktondale NY.

(Unfortunately, I don't know Jonas' or Horace's middle names, and I suspect that Horace's date of death is not precise either.)

Father: Edward Hallock Mills, born 25 Mar 1819, Smithtown, NY, died 01 Jan 1908, Brookton, NY.
Mother: Mary Ann (Pine) Mills, born 08 Feb 1819, Hempstead NY, died 28 Dec 1895, Brookton NY. 

So far, I have searched ancestry, Presbyterian Church records, etc., and have not found the exact 

Thank you in advance for any further assistance you are able to provide.
