To do:

  - Photo sharing method?
  - gas money?

As you go through each box and folder, make note of what you have reviewed so that future trips can be planned taking that into consideration.

When taking photos remember to:

  - lay the document as flat as possible on the table
  - hold the camera as flatly as possible. If it automatically rotates the wrong way in the process, that is OK as long as it is in focus.
  - if unsure about focus, don't worry about deleting a photo and retaking it, simply take as many photos of something as you feel is necessary, I can weed through them later and would rather you make the most of your time with the materials.
  - for photos with writing on the back and other double-sided documents, make sure you photograph the reverse side immediately after the front side to ensure they are properly matched up later.
  - get as close as possible while still capturing the edges of the photos/documents.
  - for items that are large, detailed, or faded:
      - begin with a photo of the complete side, as close as possible while still capturing edges, same as above. 
      - take photos of sections of the page in a predicable way, for example, taking four photos in this manner:
            ---------
            | 1 | 2 |
            ---------
            | 3 | 4 |
            ---------
      - take even more zoomed in close ups as you see fit after that, for example, if only a part of the page is faded, or there is a particular part that is worthy of special focus.
      - repeat for the reverse side if applicable.

Primary questions, etc.:
   - Looking for photos of members of Edward Mills' family.
   - Verifying exact birth dates for the children:

   - Verifying exact death date for Horace.
   - Verifying full middle names for Jonas and Horace.
   - Information on the circumstances of deaths of Jonas and Horace.
   - Information related to Staten Island (1840's through early 1860's) and Corfu NY (early 1860's through 1879) and after 1879, Motts Corners/Brookton/Brookondale. In particular, why did they move to each place?
   - Information about Mills' family relations in Buffalo and Naples NY.

Materials to prioritize:
    - Any photos, particularly of people.
    - Items related to Jonas Mills should be closely examined, as this is Edward's father.
    - Genealogical data:
        - photos of all genealogy charts and information on surnames, the "family index" etc.
        - look for birth, death records, etc. written in family bible
        - if the genealogies are complete books, that isn't realistic to photo all pages, so make note of the number of these, basic description of contents if practical.
    - Letters of James H. Mills first, then other Mills family correspondences
    - Will of Timothy Mills
    - if practical, get a list of the "journals" mentioned in the inventory along with a basic description of what it is (a particular person's diary for example)
    - if practical, photograph contents of "Narragansett Fort Flight/Hempstead History" otherwise, note a basic description e
    - Likewise, "English ancestry" photograph complete contents if practical, note its description otherwise.(Title, subtitle, authors, length, handwritten or typeset, etc.)
    - Likewise for "B.F. Thompsonâ€™s Mills Family History"
    - ... Smith Family Genealogy
