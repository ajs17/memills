		fulltext:‘When it came time for the pioneer farmer to harvest his hay, he mowed it by hand with a scythe and raked it with a hand rake. Machines were not available, and had they been their use would have been limited. Stumps and other obstructions and uneven surfaces defeated machines for many years. Grain was first cut with a sickle, the grain cradle being unusable until field obstructions were overcome. The straw lay in a regular swath which was raked by hand into sheaves that were stacked in shocks to ripen fully.

Paying for Land Difficult
After only 175 years, it can scarcely be imagined how difficult it was for farmers to pay for their lands. Most of the settlers who came into Caroline—or into the county, for that matter—were men of small means; their chief assets were determination and ability to work hard and long under adverse conditions.

		fulltext:Merely recounting the story of Henry Quick conveys small information as to how he and his wife accomplished the work for which they stand credited. They worked with a small beginning; perhaps two or three acres of land were cleared each year. At first this acreage could be expected to produce little more than a subsistence let alone pay taxes, interest on indebtedness and make a token payment on the principle.

		fulltext:the inevitable pork barrel in which the meat was preserved in salt brine. So strong became the odor of this barrel that the housewife and her family were glad when spring came so that it could be scrubbed and set in the sun to “sweeten” for use again the next fall.
Add to this collection the few pieces of furniture and other necessary items of a primitive household, one wonders how the housewife did her work.

With such aid as her children might give her, she assumed these outdoor duties so that the men folks might devote longer hours to the work of the fields and forests—and, perchance to her, an escape from the confines of the cabin.

		fulltext:barefooted. From early spring to late fall, boys and girls went barefoot; most adults did part of the time. Going shoeless for pasturing cows on frosty, late fall mornings, youngsters would chase the cows up to warm their feet where the animal had lain.
Buttons were hard to come by, so substitutes were fashioned from thread; safety pins were a later invention. Men’s pants opened at the sides and their shirts buttoned at the back; both were homemade.

Before felt boots appeared, coarse shoes and leggings were fall and winter footwear for men and school children. All wore woolen stockings or socks through winter and into late spring.
Nearly every early home had a spinning wheel and loom, and every housewife was skilled in operating them to make the necessary fabrics for the family.

		fulltext:Foodstuffs Mostly Home-grown
Potatoes were a year-around staple article of food. Grown plentifully in the new soil, cultivation and harvest required a minimum expenditure of time and labor; preserved easily in outdoor cellars, they kept well. A favorite method of cooking was to cover them in the ashes of the fireplace and roast them.
Wheat was a salable grain, both for flour and distilling, so it was less eaten than rye and corn.

Persons accustomed to the use of electric lighting of today are hard put to imagine how life was endured and much work done by the primitive lighting of the cabins. At first, pine knots were used as faggots to furnish light to work by, but most unsatisfactorily for they smoked, smelled and flickered. With a small reservoir filled with lard and a wick of scrap cloth inserted and ignited, the lard lamp gave but a dim glow.
