		fulltext:were other alterations in some districts and some new ones laid out so that by October 27, 1820, there were 19 school districts. Some of these embraced territory in Dryden and Danby in agreement among school commissioners of the three towns.
The new common school law made necessary some changes in the town laws, so a special meeting of the Town Board met September 27, 1813. This meeting named Gerrett Mandevell and Silas Hutchinson, inspectors.

A less embarrassing use of the dunce block was as an elevation for small pupils when they were reciting. They were mounted upon it so they might be seen as well as heard.
Town Lays Out Roads Early
Newcomers into the county traveled over roads that were little more than trails.

		fulltext:entry immediately following is dated April 27, 1811. It would appear the road in question had been laid out but not surveyed prior to the fall of 1811.
As entered in the first book of town records, surveys and alterations of highways were continuing in 1825. By that time there were some 47 roads in the young town, and these were assigned to road districts in charge of pathmasters. It was the duty of these officials to keep the roads in repair, and each spring they called out the property owners to do “road work” with men and teams.

		fulltext:PREFACE
Caroline has been selected as a typical town of the hundreds that were carved out of the wilderness in Central New York. The people who pioneered here had their counterparts among those who conquered the forests throughout the land; they were motivated by the same desires, met the same problems and overcame them by the same means as did those who changed the face of Caroline in so few years.

After roads had been built, tin peddlers began their rounds through the new country. In exchange for their shiny wares they took pelts, bones and later pieces of iron, brass and other metals. Carrie Manning, in her diary of November, 1869, tells of such a transaction in these words:
“There was a tin peddler here. Ma sold a sheep pelt and got three bake tins. Em and I sold some old iron and got seven individual salt cellars and thirteen clothespins.

From DeWitt Museum Collection BIG BRIDGE AT MOTT’S CORNERS
As indicated by the inscription, this drawing was made November 13, 1879, by May H. Tobey. Little other information concerning the artist or bridge has come to light, as no one has been found who remembers the structure and only a few persons have personal recollections of the wielder of the pen. “May” appears to be a nickname as the census of 1850 lists her as Marion H.

The bridge was 60 feet long and 14 wide, and substantially built of large, hewn timbers and heavy planks. The trusses were fastened to the sills with bolts that were both large and long.

It was the second Tuesday in February when the drive opened. Every man had his knapsack full of victuals and he got a fresh supply at each house he passed.

		fulltext:Even the hand tools the farmer used were clumsy and inefficient. Like most of the tools of the day, they were the product of the local blacksmith shop whose production ranged from hoes, adzes, hammers, through door hinges and locks to bear traps. One of the latter is displayed in the DeWitt Museum along with a large collection of early tools and devices made of iron, wood and tin.
Mowing of hay was done with the scythe.

But these bees were not confined to the forest and field: women frequently arranged a spinning, quilting or sewing bee. The woman who organized a spinning bee would distribute wool among those she invited; this they spun and on the appointed day came with their skeins of yarn to knit it and visit, then join their hostess in supper. In the evening there would be dancing and games.
