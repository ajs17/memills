		fulltext:The housewife made her own yeast, and for today’s baking soda and baking powder she resorted to corn cobs. These were burned in the baking kettle and the resulting ash was a substitute for today’s leavening.
Because tea and coffee were expensive and beyond the pocketbook of the early rural family, varied substitutes were employed. Rye grain, dried peas, beechnuts, chestnuts, corn, and chickory were roasted in a pan and used in place of coffee.

Often they leaked: one newcomer to Lansing said that the only dry places in his cabin were under the table or the bed. For window panes, greased paper was used.
In the cluttered little room of the cabin, by the light of the flames in the fireplace or by faggots or pine splinters stuck in the wall of the fireplace, the housewife did her sewing, spinning and weaving; and the fathers repaired farm equipment and boots.

Among artisans essential to every pioneer community were tanners, who produced leather from homegrown hides, and coopers. The latter made containers of wood: firkins (butter tubs), kegs, and two types of barrels, “loose” and “tight.” The former type was used for storing dry products, the latter for liquids.
Democratic Society in Operation
It was a democratic society which set up the Town of Caroline.

A counterpart of the New England village, the communities had a commons used by all residents. But roaming livestock were not to feed upon this sector, so laws were passed to protect the public area from trespass. At the first town meeting it was “Resolved, That swine shall not run on the commons.

Fitting the soil on newly cleared land was a difficult task, what with stumps and roots still strongly entrenched and only improvised implements to break the soil and prepare a seed bed. For a plow a crotched limb was used to stir the recently burned-over earth to a depth of a few inches, over which grain seeds were broadcast and then “brushed-in” with a leafless branch of a tree that was hauled by hand or by an ox team.

		fulltext:a note in his journal concerning methods employed to remove hemlocks.
“Some of the new settlers clear the lands by beginning at tops of trees and cutting limbs. The upper ones break off the lower, and they soon strip the loftiest hemlock. We saw some of the trees trimmed that way. Others prefer making roads where the trees have been cut down, so that they can root them up. The weight of the trees in falling will remove the roots, which cannot be got rid of in cutting.

		fulltext:Tanbark By-Product of Clearing
When Solomon Robison and Daniel Hedges built a tannery at Mott’s Corners in 1816, they contributed much to the development of Caroline. The tannery paid $4 to $6 a cord for hemlock tanbark delivered to the tanyard, and this income, small as it was, brought relief to the struggling settlers.
Not only did tanbark become a by-product of the clearing operations, it helped pay for the work.

		fulltext:into leather. Hemlock and white oak grew in the region, but red oak was preferred because of its greater tannin content. Oaks ranged from 8 to 10 per cent tannin; hemlock, 7 to 8 per cent. Hemlock tanning virtually came to an end in America in 1890 when British interests began to dominate the industry and specialize in oak tanning.
Where the timber was not to be used for lumber, the boles of the trees were left on the ground to decay.

		fulltext:largely upon young shrubs; this was called “browsing.” While traveling to his location, the newcomer fed his livestock along the way by chopping down young trees and bushes so that his animals might feed upon the twigs. This hampered travel but since it was impossible to carry an adequate supply of fodder on the trip, there was no other way for him to feed his stock. Often in drouths of later years the farmer resorted to feeding browse to keep livestock from starvation.
