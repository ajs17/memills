		fulltext:New Names Indicate Early Newcomers
Caroline filled up rapidly, as is indicated by the following list of residents that has been prepared from the first town clerk’s books. The roster of town officers and the town records for 1811-1824 have been searched. Not all newcomers are included because it is not likely that all families were represented on the town board or whose names appear in town records. Then, too, faded writing in the book makes it impossible to decipher several names.

		fulltext:INTRODUCTION
Lying in the southeast part of Tompkins County is the rural town of Caroline; an upland area of high, rounded hills and pleasant valleys running in many directions.
In earlier years the town’s forest trails had been trodden for centuries by the Indian. One of the seventeen important Indian trails of the State was the Warrior’s Trail, which crossed Six Mile Creek west of Brooktondale, at the Beaverbrook Road. This crossing was just six miles from Ithaca which fact gave the stream its present name; much easier to pronounce than its Cayuga name, Teegastoweas.

		fulltext:Roads throughout the town were still primitive dirt roads, and would remain so for nearly a century; but the Catskill turnpike, built through in 1805, and the Ithaca-Owego turnpike, completed in 1812, afforded outlets to the country’s eastern markets. Over these two roads went produce of the town to the thriving markets along the Atlantic seaboard—and the world —by way of the Susquehanna and Hudson Rivers, Erie Canal and Cayuga Lake.

		fulltext:Mr. Goodrich was engaged in general farming and dairying
“Mr. Goodrich would train ten or twelve fine horses a year, and sell them. He kept the racetrack in use for 15 years or more until the market for horses slackened.
“Another reminder of “horse-and-buggy days” is the windbreak that Levi Goodrich made near his farm home as protection against the strong winds and heavy snows. He planted a fine grove and row of trees which stand today, after more than 60 years, as mighty patriarchs over snow and wind.

		fulltext:Courtesy of Charles C. Vorhis H&quot;OODEN TRESTLE OVER SIX MILE CREEK Erected in 1874 to carry the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad over the Brooktondale gorge, it was constructed of foot-square timbers supplied by neighboring forests. Its efficiency as a windbreak was not fully appreciated wntil the closely spaced timbers were replaced by a spidery steel trestle in 1894. At that time, trains did not run on Sunday, a circumstance greatly favoring Moses Hurlburt who had the contract for removing the wooden trestle.
