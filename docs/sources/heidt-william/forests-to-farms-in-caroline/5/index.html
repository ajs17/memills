				<p>fulltext:PREFACE</p>
<p>Caroline has been selected as a typical town of the hundreds that were carved out of the wilderness in Central New York. The people who pioneered here had their counterparts among those who conquered the forests throughout the land; they were motivated by the same desires, met the same problems and overcame them by the same means as did those who changed the face of Caroline in so few years.</p>
<p>A special feature of the Caroline history is the availability of the first town-clerk’s book wherein are recorded legislative enactments during a score of formative years. Here are found the original entries, descriptions of school districts, roads, earmarks, quaintly delineated, that identify livestock, a pound and a law that placed restrictions on hogs while roaming public thoroughfares.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerous public records there exists a considerable body of personal diaries, letters, and articles supplied the press. Caroline was fortunate to have had several persons who had a flare for compiling local history for newspapers of the day, and others just as devoted to preserving this material in scrapbook repositores. They and the writers are owed a debt of gratitude by today’s residents.</p>
<p>Because this material is widely applicable, it has been presented in such a manner as to make it useful beyond the borders of Caroline. Persons who tap this fund of stored-up history at the grassroot level will be rewarded by developing a fuller knowledge of the pioneer spirit and its accomplishments.</p>
<p>Ithaca, N. Y. July 10, 1965. W.HJr.</p>
