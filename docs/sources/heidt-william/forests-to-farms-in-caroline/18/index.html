				<p>fulltext:falo was threatened by the British his command was ordered to the frontier; each member of his company was given a $20 gold piece and started on a march to Buffalo. At Canandaigua the unit was informed the settlement had been burned, and ordered to return home. All of Captain Slater’s soldiers felt well repaid for their walk.</p>
<p>During the first few years after the settlement of Slaterville, a small tribe of Oneida Indians came each fall to hunt. Their chief was Wheelock, who was killed while fighting as an American soldier in the War of 1812. Their camping ground is indicated by a marker three-fourths of a mile west of Slaterville Springs and near the hill known as the “Rosy Bone.”</p>
<p>“Yankee” and “Dutch” Sectors</p>
<p>Matthew Jansen, a blacksmith of Dutch descent, settled in Slaterville in 1802, bringing a few slaves. As the eastern sector of the settlement was populated by Yankees, soon the two sections were distinguished by the names of “Yankee” settlement, and “Dutch” settlement.</p>
<p>The Rev. Garrett Mandeville came from Ulster County in 1803, settled near Brooktondale, and organized a Dutch Reformed Church there in 1810. The site of the church and cemetery is identified by a marker on Route 79 at West Slaterville.</p>
<p>On Route 79 at Caroline a marker has been placed to locate the site of the home and tavern of Nathaniel Tobey who came with his brother Samuel from Bristol County, Mass., in 1810. Nathaniel, a young married man when he migrated to Caroline, built many New England-type houses in the town.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many other settlers during the early years of the nineteenth century. The ones mentioned here have been selected to indicate the variety of skills they brought with them to the wilderness. It will have been noticed, too, that they came from the Northeast, mostly from New England and Ulster County, New York; these latter were known as the “Marbletown Dutch.”</p>
