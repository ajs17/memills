				<p>fulltext:Merely recounting the story of Henry Quick conveys small information as to how he and his wife accomplished the work for which they stand credited. They worked with a small beginning; perhaps two or three acres of land were cleared each year. At first this acreage could be expected to produce little more than a subsistence let alone pay taxes, interest on indebtedness and make a token payment on the principle. At the time production was limited by the few cleared acres, prices for their crops were small and transportation difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, new cleared land was highly productive and free from infestations that later handicapped farmers.

Root crops were stored in outside cellars, commonly called “holes,” from whch they were brought out during the long months between growing seasons.</p>
<p>As the autumn advanced, more and more bags of stored foods were hung from the rafters of the cabin. There were beans and peas, dried corn, peaches, berries; clusters of herbs for medicines and seasonings; dried and smoked beef and venison; smoked hams and sausage took their places after the fall butchering season. By the time winter shut in, the ceiling of the cabin was a veritable food storehouse.</p>
