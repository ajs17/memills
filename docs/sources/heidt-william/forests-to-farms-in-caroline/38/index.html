				<p>fulltext:The housewife made her own yeast, and for today’s baking soda and baking powder she resorted to corn cobs. These were burned in the baking kettle and the resulting ash was a substitute for today’s leavening.</p>
<p>Because tea and coffee were expensive and beyond the pocketbook of the early rural family, varied substitutes were employed. Rye grain, dried peas, beechnuts, chestnuts, corn, and chickory were roasted in a pan and used in place of coffee. When coffee was purchased, a pound lasted a year and was doled out only on occassion. It came in the whole bean to be roasted and ground as needed. It doesn’t need to be said that the resultant beverage was not “good to the last drop.”</p>
<p>Tea, too, was so costly that a half-pound sufficed for a year: it was a rare treat that was reserved for company. Among substitutes used for tea were sage, thyme, the mints, sweet fern, and dried leaves of the raspberry bush.</p>
<p>Other homemade beverages common to the times were milk, buttermilk, switchel and cider. Buttermilk was especially desired during hot weather. Switchel, another hot-weather drink, was concocted of water, molasses and ginger. Cider was consumed in vast quantities, cold in summer and in winter heated by inserting a hot poker into it.</p>
<p>Roots, leaves and seeds of herbs were gathered and preserved for medicinal purposes. Suggestive of these are catnip, tansy, elder blossoms and wormwood for children. The mints, boneset, gingseng, flaxseed and mustard were taken internally as potions, and the latter two were used for poultices in colds. Doctors were few and far between and medicine was as primitive as the culture of the pioneer community. Caring for the sick devolved upon the mothers and grandmothers. Death rates were high, especially among infants and young children.</p>
<p>Early Cabins Made Rude Shelters</p>
<p>Cabin floors were most frequently earthen, but some were of puncheons which were small poles whose topside had been flattened with an adz; others were of rough pine boards</p>
