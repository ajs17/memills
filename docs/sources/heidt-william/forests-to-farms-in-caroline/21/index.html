				<p>fulltext:sons were listed as follows: Hector, thirty-three; Ulysses, eighteen; Caroline, none; Danby, five. Descendants of Caroline slaves still live in the county, though slavery was outlawed nearly a century and a half ago.</p>
<p>A quarter mile north of the Bush Tavern site in Caroline is a marker that locates the old slave burying ground. Fourteen were buried there.</p>
<p>The first recorded manumission of a slave in the Town of Caroline is found in the town clerk’s book, as follows:</p>
<p>“This is to certify that I have this day agreed to discharge my man Peter, known by the name Peter Webb, from all further servitude as slave; that he is free to act for himself as a free man from this time forward. Witness my hand the above date.</p>
<p>“Jno. Jas. Speed. “Witness:</p>
<p>“I certify that the above is a true copy of the original in all respects.</p>
<p>“Moses Cass, T. Clerk. “March 20, 1822.”</p>
<p>Webb’s manumission was for a consideration: he bought his freedom by paying his owner $384, a transaction that may cause one to wonder where a slave obtained even that sum of money. When Webb’s services were not needed on the Speed farm he was permitted to work for others and receive payment. One of his employers was the management of the Ithaca Hotel. It is not known whether Webb was aware of the fact that by law all slaves in New York State would be freed in 1827.</p>
<p>Webb, upon becoming a freeman, set about fitting himself into the economy and customs of the community. On April 21, 1825, he registered with the town clerk the earmark for his livestock: a hole through the right ear and a crop off the left ear. It is apparent he was successful in his efforts as a freeman for his son Frederick M. Webb eventually became owner of the John Joseph Speed homestead.</p>
