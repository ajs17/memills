				<p>fulltext:manded of Speedsville of the late &lsquo;80’s were provided by small, personally owned enterprises, none of which were ever thought of as lucrative businesses. Their number and the range of their services are revealing.</p>
<p>Seth H. Akins operated a sawmill, cheesebox factory, planing mill, cider mill; when these did not keep him busy, he did contract work, one such job being the covered bridge.</p>
<p>S. K. Blackman was a buyer of stock, dealer in agricultural implements and a buyer of wool.</p>
<p>Merritt M. Campbell operated Speedsville-Owego stageline.</p>
<p>Dunham &amp; Meeks operated a meat market.</p>
<p>W. J. Gilberty was proprietor. of a combined dry goods and grocery store.</p>
<p>S. L. Hart was the community’s miller.</p>
<p>Miss Mary Havens kept the women in up-to-date millinery.</p>
<p>George W. Hawkins was a blacksmith shop operator.</p>
<p>Higgins &amp; Keeney were dealers in agricultural implements at a time when farmers were seeking new types of machines.</p>
<p>Higgins &amp; Rounseville conducted a cheese factory before the day of fluid milk shipping to the growing cities.</p>
<p>A. L. Jenks was a breeder of Percherons. These sturdy horses furnised most of the motive power in the fields or on the way to shipping points.</p>
<p>Ransom Johnson was a physician and surgeon.</p>
<p>Emmett E. Legge was an auctioneer. These “vandoo” sales were common in rural communities until well after 1900.</p>
<p>M. L. Legge was a wagonmaker.</p>
<p>W. S. Legge &amp; Co. appears to have been a busy retail outlet when their merchandise selection is considered: drygoods, groceries, hats, caps, boots, flour, feed, salt, etc. The “etc.” no doubt included liniments that were good “for man or beast.”</p>
<p>W. S. Legge kept himself busy otherwise for he was postmaster and manager of the “N.Y. &amp; Pa. Telephone office.”</p>
<p>W. S. Legge was proprietor of the Speedsville and Ithaca stage line. A busy, busy man!</p>
<p>Legg &amp; Osborn were carpenters.</p>
