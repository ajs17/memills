<p>Courtesy of Charles C. Vorhis H&quot;OODEN TRESTLE OVER SIX MILE CREEK Erected in 1874 to carry the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad over the Brooktondale gorge, it was constructed of foot-square timbers supplied by neighboring forests. Its efficiency as a windbreak was not fully appreciated wntil the closely spaced timbers were replaced by a spidery steel trestle in 1894. At that time, trains did not run on Sunday, a circumstance greatly favoring Moses Hurlburt who had the contract for removing the wooden trestle. During the week he prepared a section for removal on Sunday for replacement by steel work. Immengity of the original structure is indicated by the 800-foot length and 85-foot height of the new trestle. In 1884, the line reorganized the Elmira, Cortland &amp; Northern, and in 1905 the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company became owner of the property. Thirty years later the Lehigh abandoned service on the 25.5-mile stretch between Van Etten and Ithaca, and carly in 1936 the Beth Iehem Steel Company demolished the stcel trestle.</p>
