				<p>fulltext:Caroline Formed in 1811</p>
<p>When Tompkins County was organized on April 17, 1817, it â€˜was made up of parts of Seneca and Cayuga Counties. The towns of Ulysses, Covert and Hector were taken from the former, and Dryden, Lansing and Groton from the latter. The town of Caroline was not embraced by the boundaries of the new county.</p>
<p>Caroline, Danby and Newfield were at that time the northern tier of Tioga County towns; their territory lay within the bounds of the Watkins and Flint Tract. However, on March 22, 1822, these three towns joined Tompkins County, Newfield changing its name from Cayuta.</p>
<p>Caroline was organized as a town February 22, 1811, the same date on which Danby and Cayuta was organized, all within Tioga County. But settlement of the town had begun 16 years before, when Capt. David Rich came in 1795 and was followed by the Widow Earsley a week later. Rich built a tavern, the site of which is now marked one-half mile east of Caroline.</p>
<p>That vast virgin territory which after the Revolution came to be known as Central and Western New York was claimed by the Federal government by right of conquest after defeat of the British. Indian claims were extinguished by later treaties with the Iroquois.</p>
<p>Federal and State governments owed their soldiers for military services, but treasuries were empty. To pay these obligations and induce settlement of the wilderness, bounty grants of land were made in what became known as the Military Tract laid out in Central New York. All northern tier towns of Tompkins County and the Town of Hector fell within the tract.</p>
