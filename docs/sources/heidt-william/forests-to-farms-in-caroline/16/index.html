				<p>fulltext:is dated February 22, 1797; the original document is in the DeWitt Historical Museum.</p>
<p>When General Cantine’s son, John Cantine, Jr., came upstate in 1798 from Ulster County, his father gave him the choice between the Chemung lands and those in Caroline. The son chose Caroline because of the waterpower possibilities offered by Six Mile Creek. Two years later his father built him a gristmill at Brooktondale, the first on the stream. General Cantine died April 30, 1808. His personal monument is in Quick Cemetery and the DAR memorial is along the Brooktondale-Willseyville road, the old Leggett road.</p>
<p>The junior John Cantine’s wife was Jenni, baptized Jacqueline Francoise, a daughter of Jean Jacques Carte, L.L.D., of Lusanne, Switzerland. Born in 1782, she eloped and married Cantine when she was 16. She died in 1859. Many of the Cantine-Carte papers are in the DeWitt Historical Museum.</p>
<p>He built a log cabin and in 1804 he erected the first frame house in the town; known as the “Cantine Mansion,” it still stands at Brooktondale. Cantine proceeded to clear land and develop an agricultural industry until 1828, when he sold his farm to his brother Charles and moved to Ithaca, where he died in 1834, aged 65 years.</p>
<p>Early in 1800 Richard and Oakley Bush and James Chambers came to Caroline from Ulster County. In 1811 Richard Bush built a tavern of squared logs in which the first town meeting was held. Bush died in 1815 but his widow conducted the tavern for several years. Long known as the “Old Bush Place,” a marker on Route 79 indicates its location.</p>
<p>Newcomers Seek Opportunities</p>
<p>Whether the newcomers were farmers or artisans, they were ever on the alert for opportunities to better themselves. Two such instances are noted in the early history of Caroline.</p>
<p>Benoni Mulks was a millwright whom General Cantine brought in from Ulster County in 1800 to build the gristmill</p>
