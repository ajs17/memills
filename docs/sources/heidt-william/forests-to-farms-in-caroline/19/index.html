				<p>fulltext:But there was another increment of newcomers quite in contrast with these, for they came from Virginia and Maryland and bought large acreages from the Johnsons between 1803 and 1808. Not only did these mid-southerners bring additional skills and cultures, they brought the only large group of slaves ever introduced into the new county. A group of Southern Federalists seeking land in the Federalist North and traveling horseback, visited a large area in Central New York, then chose a location in Caroline.</p>
<p>Among this group was Augustine Boyer, a wealthy man who came from Maryland in 1803 and purchased 1,000 acres of Johnson Lands. He lined his dwelling with wide, matched boards and filled the space between the studding with mud as an insulation. This house still stands, with a long driveway leading to it from the ’76 Road. He built also a log blockhouse as protection against an Indian attack but never had an occasion to use it for this purpose.</p>
<p>In 1804, Boyer constructed the ‘’76 Road” as a memorial to the spirit of 1776. It ran easterly from Brooktondale through Caroline Center to Speedsville. Two miles east from Brooktondale a historical marker formerly indicated the site of a deerlick where early settlers, Indians and wild animals obtained salt.</p>
<p>Other members of the Southern colony were the Speeds, Hydes, Heggies and Patillos. The Speeds from Mecklenburg, Va., were the most conspicuous.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Speed was graduated from the Pennsylvania Medical College in 1803. His diploma was signed by the college president, Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Dr. Speed and his brother John came to Caroine in 1805. His plantation home, known as Spring Farm, is on the Old Level Green Road running from the hamlet of Caroline to Speedsville. Its location is indicated by a marker. Dr. Speed died in 1847.</p>
<p>John James Speed and his brother William, cousins of Dr. Speed, came to Caroline in 1805 and their father Henry fol 9</p>
