				<p>fulltext:that was plentiful in the early days when streams ran full and cold.</p>
<p>Persons accustomed to the use of electric lighting of today are hard put to imagine how life was endured and much work done by the primitive lighting of the cabins. At first, pine knots were used as faggots to furnish light to work by, but most unsatisfactorily for they smoked, smelled and flickered. With a small reservoir filled with lard and a wick of scrap cloth inserted and ignited, the lard lamp gave but a dim glow. Later tallow candles, both dipped and molded, came into use witk little improvement in illumination. Kerosene lamps and lanterns were not in general use on farms until after Civil War days, although rather ornate oil lamps were available in the late 1850’s. Danger of fires from exploding kerosene retarded use of these oil devices until after 1900.</p>
<p>Cooking in fireplaces was accomplished in several ways. Boiled foods were placed in iron kettles that were hung from trammel irons fixed into the walls of the fireplace. Bread and cake mixtures were placed in an iron kettle equipped with a cover and the kettle was then set in a bed of coals and coals were piled over the cover. The bake kettle was a low, kettle shaped iron pot with cover and bail, as may be seen by examening the one in the DeWitt Museum. This method of baking was supplanted by ovens when cast-iron stoves came upon the market. Another baking device was an oven built into the walls over the fireplace.</p>
<p>Johnnycake, a frequent item on the early farmers menu, was quickly prepared of corn meal and baked. The mixture was poured into a long-handled frying pan and baked over the fire. It was served hot with maple sirup or honey.</p>
<p>Sugar was an expensive article of commerce and the pioneer substituted maple sirup, maple sugar and honey as a sweetening. Honey came from two sources: the domestic bees that the settlers cultivated and the wild bees that stored their product in “bee trees.” Both honey and sirup were substituted for butter when that article was lacking.</p>
