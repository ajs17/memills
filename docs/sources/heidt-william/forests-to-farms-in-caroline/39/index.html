Often they leaked: one newcomer to Lansing said that the only dry places in his cabin were under the table or the bed. For window panes, greased paper was used.</p>
<p>In the cluttered little room of the cabin, by the light of the flames in the fireplace or by faggots or pine splinters stuck in the wall of the fireplace, the housewife did her sewing, spinning and weaving; and the fathers repaired farm equipment and boots. Boys and girls studied their lessons or helped their parents, and thereby acquired the skills that they must possess to make a success of pioneer life.</p>
<p>Few of the pioneers could afford watches and clocks. Time was reckoned by the sun marks cut upon a door frame or window frame. Here and there one fashioned a crude sun dial, and a few families possessed an hour glass used in timing.</p>

When Simeon Van Nortwick and family entered their new cabin on the Peruville road early in 1800, he walked five miles to West Dryden to obtain live coals to start his fireplace.</p>
