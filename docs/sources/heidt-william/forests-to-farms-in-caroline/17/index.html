He had been detailed to repair a gristmill at Schuylerville that the enemy had destroyed, but was needed to grind corn for the American soldiers.</p>
<p>Hunting and fishing along Six Mile Creek one Sunday morning, Mulks saw for the first time the flats at Slaterville. Two merchants in Chemung owned the land and wanted to sell it. That fall his son John came in with a prospecting party, and father and son decided to purchase the tract. They paid $1,000 for 325 acres; the deed is dated September 30, 1800.</p>
