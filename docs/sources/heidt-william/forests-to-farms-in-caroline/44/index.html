				<p>fulltext:Tanbark By-Product of Clearing</p>
<p>When Solomon Robison and Daniel Hedges built a tannery at Mottâ€™s Corners in 1816, they contributed much to the development of Caroline. The tannery paid $4 to $6 a cord for hemlock tanbark delivered to the tanyard, and this income, small as it was, brought relief to the struggling settlers.</p>
<p>Not only did tanbark become a by-product of the clearing operations, it helped pay for the work. Tanning used the hides of cattle and horses produced in the young community, lessened the need for importing leather, and gave work to several hands about the tannery itself.</p>
<p>Barkpeeling was carried out during June and July when the sap was in the tree and the bark could be most easily pried off. With an ax rings were cut around the log, four feet apart. The worker stood on the log and aimed his ax-strokes toward the butt of the log so that the first strip of bark would not bind against the second.</p>
<p>The bark was slit along the topside of the log with an ax, and peeled off with a spud. The spud was an iron head mounted in a wooden handle perhaps 21 4 feet long. The head was semicircular, thick at the top and coming to a circular edge at the end of the tool. This edge was about 3 inches in length but it was not sharpened to cutting keenness. The head was inserted into the slit, the bark pried off, and the strips were piled into cord lots to dry. A specimen spud is in the DeWitt Museum.</p>
<p>Barkpeeling called for hardy men to withstand the physical effort, the heat and the myriads of flies, mosquitoes and gnats that infested the forst in summer. It was both hot and hard work,</p>
<p>Tannin was the agent in the bark which converted raw hides</p>
