				<p>fulltext:from the uppper side of the right ear and a half-penny from the upper side of the left ear. A penny was the size of today’s 50c.</p>
<p>A counterpart of the New England village, the communities had a commons used by all residents. But roaming livestock were not to feed upon this sector, so laws were passed to protect the public area from trespass. At the first town meeting it was “Resolved, That swine shall not run on the commons.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this enactment did not keep the swine at home, for at the 1812 meeting a new ordinance read: “Resolved, That hogs shall not be free commoners.” Somebody must have become a little angry at the nuisance, for one notes “swine” in the former law was changed to “hogs” in the new ordinance.</p>
<p>Another problem the town board met squarely was that of boars and rams rambling around the settlement, scaring the wits out of women and children, no doubt. A law was passed at the 1812 session that placed them under control.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that some owners called to account before the justices contended their fences were adequate. To end all squabbling on this point, the town fathers “Resolved, That a fence shall be six feet high to be lawful.”</p>
<p>Still troubled by the roaming livestock and the violations of the sanctity of the commons, the town meeting of 1813 “Resolved, That the supervisor raise money to build a pound 30 feet square of oak or chestnut timber and the supervisor to let said pound to be built by the lowest bidder.”</p>
<p>Where to locate this pound was not left to chance, for it was “Resolved, That Joseph Chambers, Laban Jenks and John J. Speed be a committee to fix a site of said pound and that they meet on the first Monday in May for said purpose.”</p>
<p>Land Clearing Slow, Wasteful</p>
<p>Like all pioneers of the time, those in Caroline cleared the land with primitive tools that are seldom seen outside museums. The ax was the chief instrument for attacking the forest giants; crosscut saws, later much used by farmers and woods 31</p>
