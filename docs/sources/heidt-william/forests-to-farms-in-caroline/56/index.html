				<p>fulltext:New Names Indicate Early Newcomers</p>
<p>Caroline filled up rapidly, as is indicated by the following list of residents that has been prepared from the first town clerk’s books. The roster of town officers and the town records for 1811-1824 have been searched. Not all newcomers are included because it is not likely that all families were represented on the town board or whose names appear in town records. Then, too, faded writing in the book makes it impossible to decipher several names.</p>
<p>The records were prepared by several persons who occupied the office of town clerk, each with his own style of penmanship and a decidedly individualistic system of spelling. Read is found on one page, and Reed and Reid on the next; Vorhis is Vorice and Voris. There are many other spellings equally non-conforming.</p>
<p>Dates in the list are of the year in which the person’s name first appears in the records. He may have moved into the town some time before, but the list at least suggests newcomers and the approximate time of their arrival in Caroline. Peter Webb, who was brought into Caroline as a slave boy in 1805, became a freeman and took his place in the community in 1822,</p>
<p>Allen, Moses 1822 Booth, Deacon 1804 Ashley, Dr. James 1814 Boyer, Augustine 1805 Ashley, Simeon 1821 Boyer, Hugh 1811 Austin, Sylvester 1824 Boyer, Thomas M. 1830 Banks, Ezra 1818 Brainard, James 1818 Beach, Jabez 1824 Braley, Joseph 1815 Besemer, James 1834 Briggs, Elisha 1815 Bishop, James 1813 Bull, Aaron 1805 Blackman, Abraham 1812 Burlingame, Brown 1821 Blair, George 1813 Bush, John 1811 Boice, Abraham, Jr. 1812 Bush, John F, 1824 Bonny, Jethro 1821 Bush, Oakley 1812</p>
