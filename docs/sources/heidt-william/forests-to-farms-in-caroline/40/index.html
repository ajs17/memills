				<p>fulltext:hickory timber was frayed to form brooms; corn husks tied to a handle served the same purpose.</p>
<p>Among artisans essential to every pioneer community were tanners, who produced leather from homegrown hides, and coopers. The latter made containers of wood: firkins (butter tubs), kegs, and two types of barrels, “loose” and “tight.” The former type was used for storing dry products, the latter for liquids.</p>
<p>Democratic Society in Operation</p>
<p>It was a democratic society which set up the Town of Caroline. It was natural that the New England town meeting form of government would be the pattern for most of the settlers were from that section of the nation. Referring to the first town clerk’s record, now in the DeWitt Museum, some excerpts are presented here.</p>
<p>On the wilderness farms there were as yet few fences and farmstock was likely to roam. A commingling of cattle made it difficult for an owner to decide which were his, so a system of earmarks was developed and recorded as the first entry in the new book. Under each settler’s name was entered a brief description of the mark he used to distinguish his livestock. To make certain the description would be understood—and perhaps because some of the settlers could not read—the town clerk drew a pen sketch of the head of the animal and indicated the markings on the ears.</p>
<p>Some of these descriptions follow as excerpts from the original document now in the DeWitt Museum.</p>
<p>Levi Slater—A crop on the right ear and a slit under same.</p>
<p>Augustine Boyer—A crop on the right ear and a crop and a half-moon in the upper and underside of the left ear.</p>
<p>Matthew H. Jansen—A crop off from the right ear.</p>
<p>Registration of earmarks with the town clerk continued as late as June 3, 1845, when Peter Meddaugh’s mark was entered as follows: Half-penny from the underside and a half-crop</p>
