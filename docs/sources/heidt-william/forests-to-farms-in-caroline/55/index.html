				<p>fulltext:experienced hunter, kept seven families from starvation by bringing them game.</p>
<p>But these bees were not confined to the forest and field: women frequently arranged a spinning, quilting or sewing bee. The woman who organized a spinning bee would distribute wool among those she invited; this they spun and on the appointed day came with their skeins of yarn to knit it and visit, then join their hostess in supper. In the evening there would be dancing and games. On other occasions, the women brought their spinning wheels to the home of their hostess and spent a busy day at work and visiting.</p>
<p>Quilting and sewing bees usually were arranged when some woman in the community had met with adversity. Then the neighbors would come equipped to spend the day at work and in visiting.</p>
<p>In season, husking bees, apple cuts and spelling school offered diversion, especially for the young people of the community. Husking was done in the fall after the corn was shocked; the apple cuts were held after the apple harvest. The apples were pared, sliced and dried for both home consumption and for the market. Spelling school was a winter pastime carried on at the schoolhouse. These and dancing were the chief sources of entertainment engaged in by the young folks.</p>
<p>Six-Mile Creek Bridge Cost $65</p>

<p>“Sir, we report to your honorable body that we have expended $65 in building a bridge across Six Mile Creek, near John Cantine’s, for which we pray you to raise said sum on said Town of Caroline at your next annual meeting.”</p>
