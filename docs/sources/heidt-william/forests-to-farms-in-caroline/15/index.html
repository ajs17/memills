				<p>fulltext:there were 905 residents enumerated and others continued to come in until as late as 1838. Not all remained, but the Rich and Earsley families proved so steadfast to the soil that descendants are found there today.</p>
<p>Among those early families who did not take permanent roots were Thomas Tracy and son Benjamin who came in 1797, and Prince Tracy, brother of Thomas, who arrived a little later. This family moved to Owego where Benjamin F. Tracy was born. He became a lawyer and was a brigadier general who commanded colored troops in the Civil War. He served as Secretary of the Navy in the administration of President Benjamin Harrison, 1889-1893.</p>
<p>General Cantine Receives Patent</p>
<p>Next came a settler who had planned his coming. He was Gen. John Cantine who had commanded New York State militia in the Revolution. Before his military service, General Cantine had been interested in the unsettled lands of the state as early as 1767, so it was logical that he should be named to a commission to settle boundary disputes in the valleys of the Susquehanna, Chemung and Tioga Rivers. The other two members were Gen. James Clinton and John Hathorn.</p>
<p>The disputes they were to adjudicate grew out of settlements in the region before it had been surveyed and alloted. While engaged in this survey, the commissioners made selections of lands for themselves and their friends. One of these selections was of 3,200 acres in Caroline and known as the Cantine “Great Location” and the Cantine “Little Location”, the latter a mile wide and four miles long. His patent was granted by the State early in 1792.</p>
<p>Members of the State militia were entitled to 100 acres each. Many of them assigned their claims to General Cantine, but other claims he bought for reconveyance to rightful claimants. Among these sites was the land where the city of Elmira is located, for Chemung County then embraced an area set off from Tioga in 1835. Cantine’s 1,000-acre grant in Chemung</p>
