				<p>fulltext:The march began just north of Slaterville on a line eastward to Hunt’s Corners and westward to near Slaterville. Every man on the line advanced, firing his gun, yelling and ringing his bell. At night dry trees were set on fire at frequent intervals to frighten the predators.</p>
<p>It was the second Tuesday in February when the drive opened. Every man had his knapsack full of victuals and he got a fresh supply at each house he passed.</p>
<p>The line was kept in the shape of a semicircle so as to drive the animals into the center of a narrowing circle. Some wolves were slain, but most of them kept well out of the way so that there were many of the beasts collected ahead of the line. On Thursday night, when the line halted at Gaskill, the hungry wolves killed and consumed six large sheep near there.</p>
<p>Friday was the last day of the drive, by which time the animals had been driven across the Susquehanna River. After that wolves were far less numerous on the Tioga-Tompkins border than they had been for a long time, but residents of the section south of the river and down into Pennsylvania long held a bitter grudge against the group for driving the pests over on them.</p>
<p>Steel Plow Invented 1813</p>
<p>The early plow was a wooden device equipped with one handle and a wooden mouldboard. The first steel mouldboard plow was the invention of Jethro Wood of Scipio, Cayuga County, in 1813. Improvements on the plow continued for more than a half century until a satisfactory implement was developed.</p>
<p>The early harrow was no more than a forked section of a tree through the branches of which holes were bored and wooden pegs set. Later the pegs were of iron and the device was called a “peg-tooth” harrow. Still later the spring-tooth harrow was developed; but had it been produced earlier in the century its usefulness would have been greatly reduced by the roots and stumps in the fields.</p>
