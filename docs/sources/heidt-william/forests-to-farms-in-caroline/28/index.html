				<p>fulltext:Dwellings were constructed after the same pattern and much the some proportions. Space between the two center bents formed a hallway with stairs leading to the second floor, and underneath these stairs another set led to the cellar. Customarily, to one side of the hall was a large room called the parlor; to the rear of the parlor was a seldom-used bedroom for guests. On the opposite side of the hallway was a living roomkitchen where the family spent most of its indoor time. To the rear of this room were two smaller rooms that might afford bedrooms, and further to the rear of these was a summer kitchen that in winter was piled with firewood. Any space not occupied here served for a workshop where carcasses were cut up, harness repaired and shingles made in severe weather.</p>
<p>Before sawmills were in operation, floor timbers for dwellings were usually hewed square, but for barns logs were merely hewn flat on one side. This was true for rafters for barns. Sheathing covered these rafters and hand-shaved shingles completed the roof of house or barn. Such roofs were famed for long service, even 60 years or more.</p>
<p>Water-powered sawmills until well along in the 20th century used up-and-down saws that were both slow and inaccurate; timbers in old buildings may be identified as so sawn by straight kerfs and great variations in dimensions. To even fittings necessary, as in flooring timbers, much handwork was called for. Such surfaces might be evened by a plane, and adze on coarser work, or a shim hoe to smooth a place over a joist to let the surface down even with an adjoining thinner board.</p>
<p>Shaving shingles was another skill needed by the pioneer. Tools required were few and simple: a froe, mallet, shaving knife and shingle horse. Shakes were rived with the froe from pine or hemlock butts, then placed in the shingle horse where a wooden clamp depressed by the operatorâ€™s foot held the shake firm. The fore end of the shank was then shaved thin on both sides, and the two edges smoothed by the shaving knife in a dexterous movement while the shingle was still in the clamp. A slow process, but time was compensated for by the long life of the product.</p>
