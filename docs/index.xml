      <description>Temperance groups don&#39;t appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the &#34;Royal Templars of Temperance&#34; who began meeting in 1878. They didn&#39;t seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.   — Personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian    — Apr 30, 1886 Quarterly Returns for Independent Order of Good Templars High Bridge Lodge No.</description>

      <description>Here are a few more items from the scrapbooks of Edwin DuBois Shurter (1863-1946 and his wife Alice (Burtt) Shurter (1870–1951). Edwin and Alice were both committed scrapbookers, collecting items and creating their scrapbooks independently at first, and then together once they were married. They clearly had great affection for each other, spending every spare moment together enjoying the finer things in life, including traveling, seeing concerts and plays, etc. Alice&amp;rsquo;s personality in particular comes shining through, as she had a clever and whimsical sense of humor and probably kept the professor on his toes!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Good of the Order&amp;rdquo; Brookton, Dec 14, 1883 Bro Arthur Denman was next on the list- but he said his selection was of teh solemn order, and not quite suited to the occasion. Bro Sanders encouraged him by saying, it will be funny when you read it but he still hesitated, so the next was called.
&amp;hellip; By this time Bro A. Denman had decided to experiment on us with his solemn article.</description>
