      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon moving to Mott&amp;rsquo;s Corners, Edward restarted his general store, now simply &lt;em&gt;E. H, Mills&lt;/em&gt;, on his own, with his son Jonas working as clerk. Emily would eventually also work as clerk in the store, taking it over upon Edward&amp;rsquo;s death and operating it as &lt;em&gt;M. E. Mills&lt;/em&gt; until her death in 1937.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomena of the mid 1800&amp;rsquo;s to the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Mills Family in Staten Island NY</title>
      <link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/staten-island/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850&amp;rsquo;s, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be &amp;ldquo;of Factoryville&amp;rdquo;. All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown&#34;&gt;Bartlett Brown (1833-24 Nov 1902)&lt;/a&gt; and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine&#34;&gt;Charles Mills Pine (1812-8 Oct 1897)&lt;/a&gt;, who may have been related to Edward through Edward&amp;rsquo;s mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills &amp;amp; Co. in Corfu, and it would appear that Charles likely acted only as an investor in the business and was not likely to be involved in its day-to-day operation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research was made possible by the generosity of many people who have offered their time, access to their materials and access to their knowledge, to allow me to start putting the puzzle pieces of Emily&amp;rsquo;s life together. I apologize to those I have forgotten; these I recall in no particular order: Molly Adams, Donna Eschenbrenner, Barbara Kone, Allan Starkweather, Ken Rumble, Richard Wines, Margaret Wegener, Ted Sobel, Becky Dewitt, Sarah Michelle, Ralph Conant, Carol Coggshall, Lois Lounsbery, Bea Raponi, Emily Adams, Bill Besemer, Mike Scaglione, Elaine Sapp, Pastor Kayti Dean and the council of Caroline Valley Community Church. And those throughout the years who preserved precious memories: Gertrude Contant, E. D. Shurter, and Jessie Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
