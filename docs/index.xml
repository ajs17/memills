H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&amp;rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jesse Brewer took over the store and ran it for many years under her name, after which, the building became the location of the post office. The Mills&amp;rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edward H.

There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Horace F.

When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be &amp;ldquo;of Factoryville&amp;rdquo;. All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of &lt;a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown">Bartlett Brown (1833 to 24 Nov 1902)&lt;/a> and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of &lt;a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine">Charles Mills Pine (1812 to 8 Oct 1897)&lt;/a>, who may have been related to Edward through Edward&amp;rsquo;s mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills &amp;amp; Co. in Corfu, but it&amp;rsquo;s likely that Charles acted only as an investor, and perhaps also an adviser, in the business and was not involved in its day-to-day operation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ellen Gould</title><link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/gould-ellen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/gould-ellen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ellen Jane (Andrews) Predmore Gould, born 27 Mar 1848, died 31 Oct 1929. Ellen lived in the Mills&amp;rsquo; home, possibly for over a decade, to help care for Hannah and to help Emily with the home and store. She was a devoted member of Brookton Baptist Church and active in the temperance movement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genealogy and Long Island Origins</title><link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/genealogy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/genealogy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edward H. Mills&amp;rsquo; ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown on Long Island and to this day the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)">Mills Pond District&lt;/a> is named for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Historical Names</title><link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/historical-names/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/historical-names/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some of the relevant historical names referenced throughout this material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hallocks in Caroline</title><link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/caroline-hallocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/caroline-hallocks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Although there is likely no direct connection between the two families, it is interesting to note that there are a number of Hallocks in the Danby and Caroline area coinciding with the Mills&amp;rsquo; time in the area. But obviously, if these Hallocks are related to Edward&amp;rsquo;s mother, it would certainly suggest reasons why Edward chose to move the family to Mott&amp;rsquo;s Corners.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acknowledgements and Areas of Further Research</title><link>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/research/</guid><description>&lt;p>This research was made possible by the generosity of many people who have offered their time, access to their materials and access to their knowledge, to allow me to start putting together the puzzle pieces of Emily&amp;rsquo;s life.
