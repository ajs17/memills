      <description>Information Yet To Be Incorporated Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:
 Horace&amp;rsquo;s death. Temperance activity. Mills family history in Long Island. Fill out Hannah&amp;rsquo;s first marriage, children. Many more newspaper clippings about Hannah and Emily. Ellen Gould. Mills&#39; store sales ledgers. E. H. Mills &amp;amp; Co. in Gloversville. Summary of census data. More context of Emily&amp;rsquo;s baptism. References to other secondary historical accounts mentioning Emily.</description>

      <description>From the Bicentennial Book: William Osburn was born on March 11, 1906, the son of Walter Grant Osburn, and has been a lifelong resident of Speedsville. He retired from National Cash Register in 1971. He, like his father, grandfather and uncles, is a very good carpenter. Besides being an excellent gardener and &amp;ldquo;history collector&amp;rdquo;, he is fondly known by all the residents of Speedsville as the unofficial &amp;ldquo;town historian&amp;rdquo;. He has written many articles for the DeWitt Historical Society and the book The Hills of Caroline.</description>
