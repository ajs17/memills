<p>Do your records indicate that he was preaching in Sept 1906, or was that when he was officially hired?

Need to research that again, but believe that is when he first signed the minutes so probably preaching.  Our records being scanned - will need to get them back to review.</p>

<h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>
<p>I have recently learned of a very influential, foundational feminist author based in upstate New York, Annis Ford Eastman, whose writings have gone out of print. I propose not only reading and learning from these texts but completing a project to preserve these writings, so they are available to researchers today and into the future. In the process, I will deepen my appreciation of aspects of this type of library work that I have not directly done before, and I will gain a deeper understanding of emerging technologies and practices such as the JAMStack architecture, and how they can serve our organizational mission.</p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<p>This proposal seeks to simultaneously address these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity and inclusion: I will read and learn from historical feminist literature, preserve, and make these writings accessible and discoverable in a way that they would not likely ever be otherwise so that others can also read and learn from them.</li>
<li>The institution&rsquo;s cultural heritage mission: this project will seek to discover, inventory, digitize, transcribe, catalog, and republish significant historical artifacts that are in danger of being lost, for the benefit of all.</li>
<li>Professional development: I will deepen my understanding of digitization workflows and copyright clearance, I will gain a deep understanding of technologies new to me, such as Tesseract and Hugo and as a result, gain insight into how our organization can better leverage evolving web architecture best practices around static site generators, Github as a content repository, etc. I believe this project will show that Hugo is capable of more than being a small website generator and can be a flexible solution to many complex web-based applications in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed timeline and deliverables:</p>
<p>Phase 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>An annotated bibliography of the known writings of Annis Ford Eastman, as complete as possible and practical to determine availability of materials and project scope.</li>
<li>Facilitate copyright clearance on all materials.</li>
<li>Through a test volume, develop a scalable digital transcription workflow capable of being efficient with as little as one person, along with generalizable and documented code to automate processes, and a record of the process, lessons learned, best practices, etc.</li>
<li>Develop time and cost estimates, technical infrastructure, and a project plan around a generalizable approach to digitally transcribe these materials, manage content and metadata, and republish in multiple formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assuming everything looks achievable, and I get the organization&rsquo;s approval, execute project with monthly written reports of progress against the plan.</li>
<li>Develop a collection policy as appropriate.</li>
<li>Consider adding supplementary materials, such as biographical information on the writer, contextual annotations of the text itself, etc. Publish complete bibliography.</li>
<li>All data, metadata, research materials, website code, everything pertaining to the project that is not sensitive will be available in a public Github repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I (may) need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some portion of work time. I will fill the roles of project manager, technical lead and primary stakeholder at least until Phase 2 is completed.</li>
<li>Help with acquisition of materials as needed, possibly including special ILL arrangements and the purchase of rare materials.</li>
<li>Help from library staff with appropriate expertise to:
<ul>
<li>assist with copyright clearance,</li>
<li>assist with accessibility testing and compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I start this investigation in September, I could try to have the Phase 1.1 completed and progress made on Phase 1: 2 and 3 by the end of the year and try to complete all of Phase 1 by the second quarter 2022.</p>
