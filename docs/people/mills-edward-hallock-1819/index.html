<blockquote><p>1908 Deaths Continued</p>
<p>Edward Hallioch Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In March 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.</p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo; however these seem to be errors as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>

<blockquote><p><strong>IN TRIBUTE TO EMILY MILLS</strong></p>
<p>To the Editor of The Journal:</p>
<p>The recent death of Miss Emily Mills, a long-time resident of Brooktondale, deserves more than passing notice. For some thirty years she conducted at this place the general store in which she formerly served as helper to her father.</p>
<p>Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly, she aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending credit for groceries to many needy individuals. Paraphrasing the remarks of Robert G. Ingersoll at his brother&rsquo;s funeral: If everyone to whom Miss Mills extended a helpful hand were to place a floral emblem upon her grave, she would sleep today amidst a wilderness of flowers.</p>
<p>A devoted member of the Congregational Church at this place, teacher in the Sunday School, she went about her daily round of duties with a Christian fortitude and faithfulnes that were greatly appreciated and will be long remembered by her host of friends who join in this tribute to the memory of one who, even as her great Exemplar, went about doing good.</p>
<p>E. D. Shurter,
Brooktondale</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.</p>
<p>These records show us how Emily&rsquo;s store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920&rsquo;s, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward&rsquo;s entries decades before, these are more modern books that also racked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; pages to teach how to use the forms within.</p>

<p>There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800&rsquo;s, who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos can be found of him online.</p>
<p>A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.</p>

</ul>
<p>Church Records and Baptism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entries mentioning Emily or Edward before they officially joined?</li>
<li>Any information on this event from Park Church, any diaries of Reverend Ford Eastman?</li>
<li>Is there significance to the date? Easter was on 3/31 in 1907. 4/7 did fall on a Sunday</li>
<li>Catalog all information about Reverend Annis Ford Eastman, including her return trips, see if Emily&rsquo;s baptism was the Rev&rsquo;s last visit to Brookton.</li>
<li>Look at Ithaca papers on, immediately after that day?</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo inventory and digitally transcribe the complete notebook of Good Templars meeting minutes. Try to find a link between Horace&rsquo;s death and Emily&rsquo;s temperance activities, and a possible clue to Mott&rsquo;s Corners move.</li>
<li>Research Emily&rsquo;s baptism, possibly contacting descendents of Annis Ford Eastman for information on that event.</li>
<li>The dimenions and timing of the (&ldquo;approximately&rdquo;) 1915 photo of Brooktondale Road that shows the front of M. E. Mills and the Mill&rsquo;s home could have been taken by Alice Shurter?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physical-artifacts-remaining">Physical Artifacts Remaining</h3>
<p>The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this.</p>
<p>There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter Hotel next door (the Shurter Hotel sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton).</p>
<p>In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection.</p>
<p>Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866.</p>
<p>We actually have copious amounts of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting spanning many decades:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880&rsquo;s. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization. These items are kept in the Tompkins County Historical Society archives.</li>
<li>The sales ledgers of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920&rsquo;s were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The ledgers are in excellent condition, and we can match Emily&rsquo;s handwriting to the known examples from the Good Templars notes. See <a href="">Mill&rsquo;s Store Ledgers</a>.</li>

<p><a href="#a-note-on-emily-mills">A Note on Emily Mills</a>, mentions &ldquo;a little leatherette booklet&rdquo; identified with M. E. Mills, and I am attempting to locate it.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-emily-mills-by-molly-adams">A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams</h3>
<p>Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.</p>
<p>Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this &ldquo;Note&rdquo; with some interest initially, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.</p>

<blockquote><h4 id="a-note-on-emily-mills">A Note on Emily Mills</h4>
<p>Before David VanDeMark&rsquo;s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside &ldquo;M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.&rdquo; On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</p>
<p>Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s store. Emily&rsquo;s father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving &ldquo;stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton&rdquo; and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.</p>
<p>The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the &ldquo;old postoffice,&rdquo; across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on &ldquo;part of the Grist Mill Lot&rdquo; [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
twas occupied by E. H. Mills &ldquo;as tenant.&rdquo; The house lot was measured starting at &ldquo;the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race.&rdquo; The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.</p>
<p>Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its &ldquo;kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases&rdquo; (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she &ldquo;aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals.&rdquo; Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily&rsquo;s house and
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.</p>

<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Town Historian:</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>

<p>In 1907, April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter.</p>

<p>The uneven pen strokes and differences in intensity of ink show that the original record was written in fountain pen, with the lighter, marginal notes added later with lead pencil. The consistency of the pencil marks suggests these notes were all added at the same time.</p>

<p>This baptism took place in the final year of Edward&rsquo;s life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward&rsquo;s health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the care taken to quote the scripture verse used in the sermon, which uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>
<p>This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.</p>
<p>The Reverend Annis Ford Eastman made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in &ldquo;The Making of a Woman Minister&rdquo; in the book <strong>Enjoyment of Living</strong> by her son Max Eastman. The Church&rsquo;s historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the &ldquo;picked council&rdquo; she refers to in her account. The Church&rsquo;s records indicate that the Reverend did return to Brookton periodically in the years after she left. The Reverend would die in 1910 after a period of ill health, so this would have been one of her last return visits.</p>
<p>At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily&rsquo;s mother Mary Ann was the only official member of the Church, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. In the Reverend&rsquo;s account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who &ldquo;waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#a-note-on-emily-mills">A Note on Emily Mills</a>, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer would eventually purchase the Mills' home and M. E. Mills after Emily&rsquo;s death.</p>
