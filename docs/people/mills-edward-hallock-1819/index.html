<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo; however these seem to be errors as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mary-ann-mills">Mary Ann Mills</h2>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary Ann&rsquo;s maiden name is sometimes mis-transcribed as &ldquo;Pine.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Despite its title, this exceptionally well written account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.</p>

<blockquote>
<h5>A Note on Emily Mills</h5>
<p>Before David VanDeMark&rsquo;s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside &ldquo;M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.&rdquo; On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</p>
<p>Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s store. Emily&rsquo;s father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving &ldquo;stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton&rdquo; and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.</p>
<p>The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the &ldquo;old postoffice,&rdquo; across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on &ldquo;part of the Grist Mill Lot&rdquo; [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
twas occupied by E. H. Mills &ldquo;as tenant.&rdquo; The house lot was measured starting at &ldquo;the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race.&rdquo; The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.</p>
<p>Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its &ldquo;kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases&rdquo; (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she &ldquo;aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals.&rdquo; Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily&rsquo;s house and
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.</p>

<h3 id="churches-in-corfu">Churches in Corfu</h3>
<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Town Historian:</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>
