<h2 id="information-yet-to-be-incorporated">Information Yet To Be Incorporated</h2>
<p>Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mills' store sales ledgers.</li>
<li>Temperance activity.</li>
<li>Fill out Hannah&rsquo;s first marriage, children.</li>
<li>Ellen Gould.</li>
<li>Summary of census data.</li>
<li>References to other secondary historical accounts mentioning Emily.</li>
<li>More legal research on deeds for Mills' home and store, estates, etc.</li>
<li>General information about Brooktondale during Emily&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the many people who have helped me along the way&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>I have already collected much of this information, its just a matter of getting it organized here.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h2 id="genealogy">Genealogy</h2>
<p>By corroborating data from <a href="#combined-church-obituary-entry-for-edward-and-mary-ann">Caroline Valley Community Church&rsquo;s historical records</a> as well as information about Edward&rsquo;s parents in the official records of his marriage to <a href="http://localhost:1313/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819/#hannah-mills">Hannah</a>, Edward H. Mills is identified in a partial entry on an extensive genealogy covering eight generations of Mills: <a href="http://millsancestry.org">Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York</a> at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward.</p>
<p>Beginning with Edward&rsquo;s parents, according to an archived version of data from MillsAncestry.org:</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
<p><span>583.</span> <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138421270/jonas-d.-mills">Jonas Davis Mills</a> (George , Isaac , Isaac , Timothy , Jonathan , George ) was born on 2 May 1795. He died on 30 Jan 1882.</p>
<p>Jonas married (1) Mary Hallock on 25 Dec 1818 in , Long Island, New York. Mary was born on 8 Dec 1798. She died on 2 Mar 1827.</p>
<p>They had the following children:</p>
<ul>
<li>1029	M	i	Thomas James Mills was born on 13 Feb 1817.</li>
<li>1030	M	ii	Edward H. Mills was born on 25 Mar 1819.</li>
<li>1031	F	iii	Emily Tabitha Mills was born on 19 Jun 1821. She died on 11 Apr 1849.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jonas married (2) <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138421346/mary-p.-mills">Mary Platt Mills</a> daughter of Jedediah Mills and Elizabeth Mills on 25 Apr 1831. Mary was born on 30 Jan 1801 in Long Island, New York. She died on 18 Jun 1881.</p>
<p>They had the following children:</p>
<ul>
<li>1032	F	iv	Sarah Maria Mills is printed as #623.</li>
<li>1033	M	v	Robert Sydney Mills is printed as #624.</li>

<p>And to this we can add Edward&rsquo;s branch to its ultimate conclusion:</p>
<p><span>1030.</span> <strong>Edward Hallock Mills</strong> (born Smithtown NY, Mar 25, 1819, died Brookton NY, Jan 1, 1908).</p>
<p>Edward married (1) <strong>Mary Ann (Pine) Mills</strong> (born Hempstead NY, Feb 8, 1819, died Brookton NY, Dec. 28, 1895). Married on Dec 29, 1850.</p>
<p>Children:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jonas E. Mills</strong> (born Staten Island NY, 1852, died Brookton NY, Oct 13, 1885).</li>
<li><strong>Horace F. Mills</strong> (born Staten Island NY, 1854, died Corfu NY, October 27, 1876).</li>
<li><strong>Mary Emily Mills</strong> who went by &ldquo;Emily&rdquo; and often signed her name as &ldquo;M. Emily Mills&rdquo; (born Staten Island NY, 1861, died Brooktondale NY, Nov 3, 1937).</li>
</ul>
<p>None of Edward&rsquo;s children married or had children.</p>
<p>Edward married (2) <strong>Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills</strong> (1825?, died Brooktondale NY, Feb 25, 1917). Married on Dec 30, 1896.</p>
<ul>
<li>No children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edward&rsquo;s parents were married while Edward was in utero and his older brother Thomas was already a toddler.</li>
<li>The only source of Horace&rsquo;s exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.</li>
<li>Edward&rsquo;s middle name Hallock was his Mother&rsquo;s maiden name.</li>
<li>It would appear that Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily would appear to get her name from Edward&rsquo;s sister who passed over decade before Emily was born.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#deeds-for-the-mills-home-in-brooktondale">Mills home deeds</a> from the time of Emily&rsquo;s death list the following as cousins of Emily&rsquo;s as possible heirs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alonzo Mills</li>
<li>George E. Mills</li>
<li>Clarissa Etsall</li>
<li>Mary Hunting Smith</li>
</ul>
<p>Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown on Long Island and to this day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)">Mills Pond District</a> is named for them:</p>
 <figure>
 <blockquote>
It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.
<p>In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council&rsquo;s website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.</p>

This would seem to be the page and entry that Molly Adams mistook for a reference to Emily in "Town of Caroline" Chapter Two of <strong>The Towns of Tompkins County</strong>, Jane Marsh Dieckmann editor, 1998, p61-62: "From 1908 to 1925 an itinerant worker named George Jansen, who dug gardens, painted rooms or houses, washed dishes, or "kept house" when an owner went on a trip, recorded events in Brookton along with the daily weather. He noted the death of Emily Mills, who had continued her father's store for thirty years, extending credit to many needy individuals." George passed nearly two years before Emily.

<blockquote><p>1908 Deaths Continued</p>
<p>Edward Hallioch[sic] Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In March 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.</p>

<p><strong>Event occurred in Brookton, Tompkins County—Interrment at Corfu.</strong></p>
<p>Corfu, Dec 31.—The remains of Mrs. E. H. Mills of Brookton, Tompkins county, arrived here on the 4:26 p. m. train yesterday and were interred in Evergreen Hill Cemetery. The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.</p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Obviously, Edward&rsquo;s date of death is incorrect. The only connection with Jan 6 is the publication of his obituaries.</li>
</ul>
</footer>
</figure>
<p>Presumably, the fact that the family moved away from Corfu a few years after his death is more than coincidental, but that is speculation. However, this could also explain why Emily was so active in the <a href="#temperance-activity">temperance movement</a>, if alcohol was a factor in Horace&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the exact details of Horace&rsquo;s death would have ever been recorded, but I continue to search for clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have contacted the Batavia Daily News for help as they may have old editions that have not yet been digitized and made publicly available, and therefore, currently outside my ability to pursue in any other way. Although there may not be an account of his death, he may be featured in other reporting that may shed light on his life circumstances. (Then again, it appears that suicides were regularly reported on in that time.)</li>
<li>I have taken an initial photographic inventory of every page of the Good Templars meeting minutes and will read these more closely for clues.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a very big mystery relevant to the Caroline audience in particular, is why they chose Mott&rsquo;s Corners as their next destination? At this point, I have only a few vague theories to explore.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Caroline area was a particularly active area for Temperance, that could have been a draw. But, it is unclear if anyone in Emily&rsquo;s family were involved in temperance.</li>
<li>They knew someone who lived Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</li>
<li>Perhaps Edward sold products from the mills and factories of Mott&rsquo;s Corners in his store and knew of it that way?</li>

<p>This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily&rsquo;s only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>IN TRIBUTE TO EMILY MILLS</strong></p>
<p>To the Editor of The Journal:</p>
<p>The recent death of Miss Emily Mills, a long-time resident of Brooktondale, deserves more than passing notice. For some thirty years she conducted at this place the general store in which she formerly served as helper to her father.</p>
<p>Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly, she aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending credit for groceries to many needy individuals. Paraphrasing the remarks of Robert G. Ingersoll at his brother&rsquo;s funeral: If everyone to whom Miss Mills extended a helpful hand were to place a floral emblem upon her grave, she would sleep today amidst a wilderness of flowers.</p>
<p>A devoted member of the Congregational Church at this place, teacher in the Sunday School, she went about her daily round of duties with a Christian fortitude and faithfulnes that were greatly appreciated and will be long remembered by her host of friends who join in this tribute to the memory of one who, even as her great Exemplar, went about doing good.</p>
<p>E. D. Shurter,
Brooktondale</p>

<p>Hannah apparently had what must have been of very worrying health episode. This is the first mention I have found of <a href="#ellen-gould">Ellen Gould</a>, and it seems quite probable that this is an accounting of the circumstances of her coming to live in the Mills Home, to care for Emily&rsquo;s elderly step-mother which Emily herself, as a business owner, would not have had adequate time to do. Ellen was already well known to the Mills as she was also a member of the W.C.T.U.</p>

<p>Further investigation is needed, but an obvious concrete question to explore is whether or not Charles M. Pine is related to Edward&rsquo;s wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine. There is a Charles Pine that married Almira Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York, and elsewhere, his middle name appears to be Mills:</p>

<h2 id="e-h-mills-and-m-e-mills-motts-corners-and-brookton">E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills, Mott&rsquo;s Corners and Brookton</h2>
<p>It is really in Brookton where we get a sense of the family&rsquo;s finances through property deeds, reported estate information and the Mills store ledgers. The Mills likely always made a fairly modest, if stable, income from their small general stores.</p>
<p>This event took place at a time when Emily was identified as &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in E. H. Mills:</p>
<figure style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819/images/1897-03-18-ithaca-daily-journal_hu11e2b01bfafac7539ad502490bb7f1aa_39016_400x0_resize_box_2.png" width="400" height="677" alt="Mar 18, 1897, **Ithaca Daily Journal.** ">
<blockquote><p><strong>COURT RECORD</strong></p>
<p>VERDICT FOR THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.</p>
<p>&hellip;
The next case tried was that of Tompkins County vs. E. H. Mills. Edward H. Burdick for plaintiff, C. R. Wolcott for defendant. This was a case similar to the Beardsley case, an agent of the State Board of Pharmacy, purchasing poisonous drugs at the store of Mr. Mills in Brookton. In this case the jury took a different view of the matter and brought in a verdict of $50 in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.</p>
<p>These records show us how Emily&rsquo;s store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920&rsquo;s, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward&rsquo;s entries decades before, these are more modern books that also tracked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; pages to teach how to use the forms within.</p>
<p>We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic.)</p>

<p>There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800&rsquo;s, who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos can be found of him online.</p>
<p>Yet another Horace F. Mills lived iun Wawayanda, NY mentioned in Port Jervis newspapers in the 1870&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s. He was married to M. J. Mills and had a daughter Bertha who died at four months old. Perhaps most frustrating of all is an unrelated Horace Mills listed in the 1850 United Stated Federal Census as a one year old living in Darien, which is very close to Corfu. If this Horace was still living in the area at the same time as Edward&rsquo;s son, and especially being of similar age, extra care should be taken to identify any reporting on &ldquo;Horace Mills&rdquo; at the time in the local papers.</p>
<p>A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.</p>

<h3 id="physical-artifacts-remaining">Physical Artifacts Remaining</h3>
<p>The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this.</p>
<p>There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter House next door (the Shurter House sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton).</p>
<p>In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection.</p>
<p>Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866.</p>
<p>We actually have copious amounts of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting spanning many decades:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880&rsquo;s. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization. These items are kept in the Tompkins County Historical Society archives.</li>
<li>The sales ledgers of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920&rsquo;s were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The ledgers are in excellent condition, and we can match Emily&rsquo;s handwriting to the known examples from the Good Templars notes. See <a href="">Mill&rsquo;s Store Ledgers</a>.</li>

<p>Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.</p>
<p>Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this &ldquo;Note&rdquo; with some interest initially, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.</p>

<blockquote><h4 id="a-note-on-emily-mills">A Note on Emily Mills</h4>
<p>Before David VanDeMark&rsquo;s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside &ldquo;M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.&rdquo; On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</p>
<p>Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s store. Emily&rsquo;s father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving &ldquo;stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton&rdquo; and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.</p>
<p>The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the &ldquo;old postoffice,&rdquo; across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on &ldquo;part of the Grist Mill Lot&rdquo; [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
twas occupied by E. H. Mills &ldquo;as tenant.&rdquo; The house lot was measured starting at &ldquo;the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race.&rdquo; The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.</p>
<p>Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its &ldquo;kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases&rdquo; (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she &ldquo;aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals.&rdquo; Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily&rsquo;s house and
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.</p>

<blockquote><p>Emily Mills' store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>
<p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace hankerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p>
<p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p>
<p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p>
<p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for [her] and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p>
<p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p>
<p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p>

<p>We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:</p>

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 
<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn&rsquo;t exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.</p>

<p>Rev. Annis F. Eastman of Park Ch. Elmira N.Y. (a former Pastor) received them into the Ch. Baptism by sprinkling, except Miss Johnston who had been immersed a short time previous.</p>
<p>The sermon was from the text &ldquo;Strive to enter in at the straight-gate&rdquo; Luke 13-24. Communion service at the close. Three Deacons present, Cantine Lounsbery, Harvey Smiley + O. Munson</p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>The uneven pen strokes and differences in intensity of ink show that the original record was written in fountain pen, with the lighter, marginal notes added later with lead pencil. The consistency of the pencil marks suggests these notes were all added at the same time.</li>

<p>In 1907, April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter. It was to be the final year of Edward&rsquo;s life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward&rsquo;s health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the care taken to quote the scripture verse used in the sermon, as it is a translation that uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.</p>

<p>I could not find an account of this baptism in the Ithaca Journal, but there is this entry over a week later in the Elmira Gazette and Free Press, that, despite some glaring innaccuracies that can be explained, appears to reference the event:</p>
<figure style="max-width: 400px;">

<blockquote><p>**SOUTHSIDE PERSONALS</p>
<p>—The Rev. Annis Ford Eastman was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. R. I. Denman in Brooklyn over Sunday. She occupied the pulpit of the Congregational Church in that village and fifteen persons were received into the congregation.</p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Brookton was often confused with Brocton and even Brooklyn, and that is the reason for adopting the name Brooktondale. See <a href="#historical-names">Historical Names</a>. Otherwise, the use of &ldquo;village&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</li>
<li>It is referencing the wrong weekend, but it is also a relative time reference, and perhaps the difference is just a result of the text not being updated in the time between writing and its delayed publishing.</li>
<li>The reference to the Denmans would seem to be Richard L. Denman (1848-1915) and his wife Adelaide (1852-1947).</li>

<p>At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily&rsquo;s mother Mary Ann was the only one in the family on the Church rolls, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. During the Reverend&rsquo;s tenure, she would also give occassional public lectures at the Congregational Church. In the Reverend&rsquo;s account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who &ldquo;waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me.&rdquo; (From <strong>Enjoyment of Living</strong> by Max Eastman, pg 70.)</p>

<p><strong>Reverend Annis Ford Eastman</strong> officiated the ceremony. She made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in &ldquo;The Making of a Woman Minister&rdquo; in the book <strong>Enjoyment of Living</strong> by her son Max Eastman. The Church&rsquo;s historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the &ldquo;picked council&rdquo; she refers to in her account. The Church&rsquo;s records indicate that the Reverend did return to Brookton periodically in the years after she left. The Reverend would die in 1910 after a period of ill health, so this would have been one of her last return visits to Brookton.</p>
