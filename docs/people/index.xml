      <description>Information Yet To Be Incorporated Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:
 Mills&#39; store sales ledgers. Temperance activity. Fill out Hannah&amp;rsquo;s first marriage, children. Many more newspaper clippings about Hannah and Emily. Ellen Gould. Summary of census data. References to other secondary historical accounts mentioning Emily. More legal research on deeds for Mills&#39; home and store, estates, etc. General information about Brooktondale during Emily&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

      <description>From the Bicentennial Book: William Osburn was born on March 11, 1906, the son of Walter Grant Osburn, and has been a lifelong resident of Speedsville. He retired from National Cash Register in 1971. He, like his father, grandfather and uncles, is a very good carpenter. Besides being an excellent gardener and &amp;ldquo;history collector&amp;rdquo;, he is fondly known by all the residents of Speedsville as the unofficial &amp;ldquo;town historian&amp;rdquo;. He has written many articles for the DeWitt Historical Society and the book The Hills of Caroline.</description>

      <description>Here are a few more items from the scrapbooks of Edwin DuBois Shurter (1863-1946 and his wife Alice (Burtt) Shurter (1870â€“1951). Edwin and Alice were both committed scrapbookers, collecting items and creating their scrapbooks independently at first, and then together once they were married. They clearly had great affection for each other, spending every spare moment together enjoying the finer things in life, including traveling, seeing concerts and plays, etc. Alice&amp;rsquo;s personality in particular comes shining through, as she had a clever and whimsical sense of humor and probably kept the professor on his toes!</description>
