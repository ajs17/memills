				<p>Here are a few more items from the scrapbooks of Edwin DuBois Shurter (1863-1946 and his wife Alice (Burtt) Shurter (1870–1951). Edwin and Alice were both committed scrapbookers, collecting items and creating their scrapbooks independently at first, and then together once they were married. They clearly had great affection for each other, spending every spare moment together enjoying the finer things in life, including traveling, seeing concerts and plays, etc. Alice&rsquo;s personality in particular comes shining through, as she had a clever and whimsical sense of humor and probably kept the professor on his toes!</p>
<p>In the attached travel photo, date and location unknown, I will leave it to you to decide if Edwin is playing the role of someone who is sitting on top of the world or if he is reluctantly indulging Alice. My sense is that Edwin was a very willing &ldquo;partner in crime&rdquo; with Alice and any protesting he may have done would be purely for show!</p>
<p>Alice kept several dance cards from when she and Edwin were courting, and the one attached from April 24th, 1891 is typical: a &ldquo;Military Hop&rdquo; that was held &ldquo;At The Armory&rdquo; at Cornell.
The waltz is romantic, with partners facing each other closely, typically the man&rsquo;s hand on the woman&rsquo;s lower back, but if they were more modest, Edwin could have let his hand rest on Alice&rsquo;s shoulder and left space between them.</p>
<p>Note that the Armory mentioned is not Barton Hall as you may assume:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Barton Hall] was built in 1914 and 1915 and was originally designed as a drill hall for the Department of Military Science. Upon its completion it was often referred to as the &ldquo;New Armory&rdquo;, as opposed to the Old Armory, a building on the now Engineering Quadrangle that has since been demolished and replaced by Hollister Hall.&rdquo; (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Hall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Hall</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The following is a handwritten poem in the scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter, attributed to Clarence Wolcott (1864-1950) as &ldquo;Brookton&rsquo;s Poet&rdquo; and likely in Alice&rsquo;s handwriting. I did my best to transcribe the words, although some were a challenge and may be wrong. (Please leave a comment if you think I mis-transcribed anything.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also included a story from The Ithaca Daily Journal on March 18th, 1897 where Clarence is defending Edward H. Mills in court over allegations that he sold poisonous drugs in his general store E. H. Mills, that operated for 29 in the location of the &ldquo;old postoffice&rdquo; in Brooktondale. Edward lost his case.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve included Clarence&rsquo;s obituary.</p>
<p>Far Away and Long Ago
by Clarence Wolcott, Brookton&rsquo;s Poet</p>
<p>What can strike the aged student
When the springs of feeling flow
Like these words of mighty sadness:
Far Away and Long Ago.</p>
<p>How the flimsy and the paltry
Sifting out through memories' sieve,
Leave great purposes as models
after which we strive to live.</p>
<p>For our present site is blinded
Like the trooper&rsquo;s in the fray,
And we little guess the Kingdom&rsquo;s
Staked on battle of to-day.</p>
<p>Ah! The sadness of forgetting,
Ah! the pathos of the past;
First an infant, then a dreamer,
And a skeleton at last.</p>
<p>So forever run the ages,
Countless hosts of soul and breath   <br>
Sweeping on with decimation
As the final fools of death.</p>
<p>And we draw each inspiration
That is generous and grand
From the heroes and the lovers
Whose poor bones are in the sand.</p>
<p>Home, July 23, 1888.</p>
