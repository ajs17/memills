<p>The Mills&rsquo; home in Brooktondale is located at present-day (2021) 475 Brooktondale Road.</p><figure class=image width=500px>

<figcaption style=max-width:500px>02 Jan 1964 entry in the Mills' home deeds. Andrea Talmage, who owned the Mills' home in the 1990’s, had the opportunity to talk with both Carl English and Grace Vandemark who confirmed that the Mills' home had been commonly called “The Mills' Place” for many years.</figcaption></figure><p>The early history of the home is still quite murky. The mid-2000’s real estate listings say the home was built in 1865, although I can’t confirm that yet. The only owner I presently know of before the Lounsbery&rsquo;s is <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott>William Benton Wolcott</a> (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911), the son of George and Sarah Wolcott. The historical deeds for the Dalebrook Apartments (the former grist mill) indicates that William owned the adjoining, future Mills&rsquo; property, referring to it as the &ldquo;Wolcott lot&rdquo;. William lists himself as a carpenter and a painter in the census data, and he was a Civil War veteran in the 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment.</p><p>In the deeds following Emily’s death, the first three names of possible heirs listed are Emily&rsquo;s cousins, the children of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills>James Thomas Mills</a>, Edward&rsquo;s younger brother:</p><ul>
<li>Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942) Sometimes spelled as Alonso.</li><li>George E. Mills (Feb 1856 to ?)</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell>Clarissa H. Etsell (Jun 1852 to Jan 1846)</a> (misspelled as &ldquo;Etsall&rdquo; on the deeds.)</li></ul><p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith>Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938)</a> is another cousin of Emily&rsquo;s, the daughter of Edward&rsquo;s sister, Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting. For more information on these branches of the Mills family, see the accompanying account of the Mills&rsquo; <a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/genealogy/>Long Island origins</a>.</p><p>Aside from the members of the Mills family, the following people are mentioned in the deeds:</p><ul>
<li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/51355047/dewitt-f-roe>DeWitt F. Roe</a> (04 Apr 1853 to 08 Mar 1918)</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery>Edward Lounsbery</a> (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) Edward and his wife Amanda (below) are among the original, charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners. Edward died within the church while addressing the Christian Endeavor Society &ldquo;about 7 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; in the evening. &ldquo;Death, however, had come instantaneously and was caused by apoplexy brought on it is thought by the mental effort he exerted in addressing the meeting.&rdquo; (28 Nov 1904, Ithaca Daily Journal, p6.) Church records show that Edward was one of the original organizers and members of the Congregational Church, present at the &ldquo;informal meeting&rdquo; on 05 Mar 1868 at the home of Walker V. Personius that resulted in the official organization of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners on 12 Mar 1868, when Edward and Amanda are listed as charter members. It is noted in the Church&rsquo;s meeting minutes that at the 05 Mar meeting &ldquo;on motion of Edward Lounsbery Mr. William Personius was chosen chairman and Walker V. Personius secretary.&rdquo;</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery>Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery</a> (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) Amanda was clerk in the church for many years, including after Edward&rsquo;s death and many entries in the church records are written by her hand.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/148400355/esther-vorhis>Esther C. (Cary) Vorhis</a> (1836 to 23 Jan 1917) Esther is the mother of Frank Vorhis below.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100452322/frank-cameron-vorhis>Frank Cameron Vorhis</a> (1861 to 18 May 1919). Frank owned the old grist mill on the site of Dalebrook Apartments, and according to his obituary, &ldquo;Mr. Vorhis had been in the milling business at Brookton for 32 years.&rdquo; (19 May 1919, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) According to the Brookton&rsquo;s Market 2011 Calendar, Frank also owned the general store at that location from the 1880&rsquo;s to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. Frank Vorhis is the father of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162242537/charlotte-esther-pancoe>Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe</a> (02 Aug 1893 to 19 May 1964) who was <a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/baptism/>baptized</a> with Emily and Jessie Brewer and is often referred to as &ldquo;Miss Esther Vorhis&rdquo; during that time. Frank&rsquo;s son <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162243893/charles-vorhis>Charles Vorhis</a> (1913 to 1973) eventually bought the Mill&rsquo;s store building and moved the post office to that location in 1961, according to Molly Adams&rsquo; &ldquo;A Note on Emily Mills.&rdquo;</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183607645/fred-d-gilbert>Fred D. Gilbert</a> (24 Apr 1873 to 14 Nov 1941) Fred Gilbert was a prominent Ithaca businessman, working in this capacity as Emily&rsquo;s undertaker. His obituary states that he spent his boyhood in Brookton because his father, Rev. Herbert (middle initial either B. or C.) Gilbert, was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church 1872-1873. (<strong>History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.</strong> Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968.) Fred took a lifelong interest in his boyhood home, as evidenced for example, by his contribution to the Lockwood Memorial described elsewhere in this material. Fred was also known as an owner of light harness horses and as an organizer of the Tompkins County Fair.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536898/lewis-william-brewer>Lewis William Brewer</a> (24 Jun 1882 to 10 Sep 1963)</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99536961/jessie-m-brewer>Jessie M. (Shurter) Brewer</a> (27 Jun 1881 to 1974) Jessie was baptized with Emily and married Lewis W. Brewer in Danby, 27 Jun 1923. Jessie took over <a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/>M. E. Mills</a> after Emily&rsquo;s death, renaming it after herself and selling dry goods and notions, but no longer selling groceries as Emily had.</li></ul><p>A summary of the documents:</p><figure class=table id=mills-home-deeds>
