As noted in the deed descriptions, the Mills&rsquo; home was originally part of the Grist Mill property next door, what is presently Dalebrook Apartments. Over the years, the Grist Mill lot was subdivided several times.</p><p>Several phrases from the Mills&rsquo; home deeds are quoted in Molly Adams&rsquo; &ldquo;A Note on Emily Mills,&rdquo; including that the house was &ldquo;part of the grist mill lot&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;occupied by E.

Edward died within the church while addressing the Christian Endeavor Society &ldquo;about 7 o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; in the evening. &ldquo;Death, however, had come instantaneously and was caused by apoplexy brought on it is thought by the mental effort he exerted in addressing the meeting.&rdquo; (28 Nov 1904, Ithaca Daily Journal, p6.) Church records show that Edward was one of the original organizers and members of the Congregational Church, present at the &ldquo;informal meeting&rdquo; on 05 Mar 1868 at the home of Walker V. Personius that resulted in the official organization of the Congregational Church of Mott&rsquo;s Corners on 12 Mar 1868, when Edward and Amanda are listed as charter members. It is noted in the Church&rsquo;s meeting minutes that at the 05 Mar meeting &ldquo;on motion of Edward Lounsbery Mr. William Personius was chosen chairman and Walker V. Personius secretary.&rdquo;</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery>Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery</a> (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) Amanda was clerk in the church for many years, including after Edward&rsquo;s death and many entries in the church records are written by her hand. Edward and Amanda also owned the Mills&rsquo; Store building for many years.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183607645/fred-d-gilbert>Fred D. Gilbert</a> (24 Apr 1873 to 14 Nov 1941) Fred Gilbert was a prominent Ithaca businessman, working in this capacity as Emily&rsquo;s undertaker. His obituary states that he spent his boyhood in Brookton because his father, Rev. Herbert (middle initial either B. or C.) Gilbert, was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church 1872-1873. (<em>History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.</em> Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968.) Fred took a lifelong interest in his boyhood home, as evidenced for example, by his contribution to the Lockwood Memorial described elsewhere in this material. Fred was also known as an owner of light harness horses and as an organizer of the Tompkins County Fair.</li></ul><p>A summary of the documents:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/mills-home/157-593_hu23dfac8eb02968c21ccf7155d00dfecf_638473_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=1220 alt><figcaption>

Some ten years ago, having purchased the Personius Flouring Mills at Brookton, he sold his North Spencer farm and removed to Brookton, where he has since resided, and where he built up a large business, from which business, however, he was compelled to retire a year or two ago on account of ill health, he being then succeeded by his two younger sons under the firm name of F. C. & E. F. Vorhis Ha died possessed of considerable property, including a half interest in a large grain farm in North Dakota. A widow and seven children survive him.</p><p>Mr. V. was a man of strict integrity, enjoying the confidence and respect of all his business associates and a wide circle of friends. The remains were brought to North Spencer yesterday for interment at the old family burial place, and the funeral services were held at the North Spencer church at 12 o&rsquo;clock, Rev. A. B. Woodworth, of Brookton, officiating, assisted by Rev. A. Livermore of this place. —Spencer Needle.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

K. and was very glad to get it and glad to hear that you had received my letter of November 10. But of course Mrs. Phillips let you know that I was all right. I am spending a seven days’ furlough in this place. Arrived here last night. Three of us are in our room and all have separate beds (Le Palace Hotel), the best hotel in town, hot and cold running water and bath, and it equals in rank among the finest I have ever seen. My expenses are all paid so it certainly is worth while. The scenery is magnificent. The resort is surrounded by the mountains, which are covered with snow and one can go out to towns in the country and take in the most wonderful scenery in the world. They could have knocked me down with a feather when I came in the place, as I thought while I was in the army I would never get to enjoy anything like this. They gave each of us a ticket that entitled us to bathe at a hot mineral bathing house.</p><p>I have never received the Christmas box yet. Presume it was sidetracked somewhere. Quite a few of the boys never got theirs. I am glad to hear Father is improving and hope he continues to do so. Wish he was here to enjoy some of these hot mineral baths. This place is about seven miles from the Spanish border, so I think I will have Spain down in my list of countries before returning home. Will try and send all the folks cards from here. There is a large beautiful dining room in this hotel, where we get the best of food, and also served in the best of style. I am going up the mountain tomorrow on a cog railway just to take in a little more scenery. I got a letter from Russell the same day I got yours, and I guess he is well and enjoying himself. I will close for now, hoping this finds you all well and that I will be with you soon.</p><p>With love to all,</p><p>WAGONER EDWARD C. VORHIS</p><p>Co. H, 308th Ammunition Train</p><p>Am, Ex.

Monday in the First Presbyterian Church.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert died at his home, 125 E. Buffalo St., Friday, Nov. 14, 1941, after an illness of about a month. The Rev. Walter A. Dodds, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, and the Rey. A. H. Boutwell, pastor of the First Baptist Church, will officiate.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert was also known as an owner of light-harness horses. He was born at Pottersville, Pa., the son of Rev. Herbert B. Gilbert and Catherine E. Deesz. When he was six weeks old his parents moved to Brooktondale where his father served as pastor of the Congregational Church. He spent his early boyhood at Brooktondale, then moved to Cayuga Lake Park.</p><p>Managed Waterloo Firm</p><p>Before his marriage to Anna D. Yost of Fayette Township, Seneca County, in 1900, Mr. Gilbert was associated with Dr. J. W. Day, a specialist, in Waterloo. In 1900 he became associated with C. A. Genung in the S. J. Genung & Son funeral home at Waterloo. He served as manager of that firm from 1903 until 1909.</p><p>During his association with Mr. Genung, Mr. Gilbert assisted the latter in the compilation of the first textbook on embalming, in the invention of instruments, and the founding of the first school of embalming. The methods they devised at the time still are the basis for many modern embalming practices.</p><p>Came to Ithaca in 1909</p><p>Mr. Gilbert began his funeral business in Ithaca in 1909 at 122 W. Seneca St. In 1924 he purchased the E. C. Stewart property at 125 E. Buffalo St., the present location of the Gilbert Memorial Chapel.</p><p>Though active in civic life, Mr. Gilbert had no political aspirations. At one time he was approached as a possible mayoral candidate but he declined the nomination.</p><p>He was a member of the Masons, IOOF, Eagles, Elks, Moose, Knights of Pythias, Veteran Volunteer Firemen’s Association, Chamber of Commerce, Rose Hill Grange of Seneca County, Tompkins County Farm Bureau, Tompkins County Fish and Game Club, Finger Lakes District of the New York Embalmers Association, and the state and national associations of funeral directors.</p><p>Was Active in Fair</p><p>He was a director of East Lawn Cemetery and was president and director of the Tompkins County Fair from 1922 through 1929. He was the first president of the old Tompkins County Funeral Directors Association, now known as the Finger Lakes Association.</p><p>He served on the state board of embalming examiners.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert did much toward the improvement of the Fairgrounds track at Trumansburg where he maintained a string of harness horses.</p><p>Surviving are his widow, Anna D. Gilbert; one son, Carl F. Gilbert, who has been actively associated with the business for 25 years and who will carry in on, and one sister, Mrs. Catherine H. Brooks, also of Ithaca.</p><p>Friends and fraternity affiliates may call at the home from 4 to 10 p.m. Sunday. The body will lay in state at the First Presbyterian Church from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. Monday.</p><p>Members of Ithaca Lodge, 636, BPO Elks, will meet at the lodge at 7:30 p.m. Sunday to visit the Gilbert home while members of the Veterans Volunteer Fireman’s Association, who will meet in their rooms at 136 E.
