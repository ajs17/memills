				<p>Upon moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, Edward restarted his general store, now simply <em>E. H, Mills</em>, on his own, with his son Jonas working as clerk. Emily would eventually also work as clerk in the store, taking it over upon Edward&rsquo;s death and operating it as <em>M. E. Mills</em> until her death in 1937.</p>
<p>The former location of the Mills store as it looks today, at 484 Brooktondale Road. Note that the stairs leading to the second floor on the side of the building mentioned later by Gertrude Conant, are visible here on the western side of the building.</p>

<p>The following is the earliest reference to the Mills' store and recounts a misadventure that took place at a time when Emily was identified as &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in E. H. Mills:</p>
<figure style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/section-resources/data_files/1897-03-18-ithaca-daily-journal_hu11e2b01bfafac7539ad502490bb7f1aa_39016_400x0_resize_box_2.png" width="400" height="677" alt=" ">
<blockquote><p><strong>COURT RECORD</strong></p>
<p>VERDICT FOR THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.</p>
<p>&hellip;
The next case tried was that of Tompkins County vs. E. H. Mills. Edward H. Burdick for plaintiff, C. R. Wolcott for defendant. This was a case similar to the Beardsley case, an agent of the State Board of Pharmacy, purchasing poisonous drugs at the store of Mr. Mills in Brookton. In this case the jury took a different view of the matter and brought in a verdict of $50 in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

<p>It is really in Brookton where we get a sense of the family&rsquo;s finances through property deeds, reported estate information and the Mills store sales journals. The Mills family likely always made a fairly modest, if stable, income from their small general stores.</p>
<p>I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me that he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time that Frank took possession of the former Mills store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled &ldquo;41&rdquo; is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceeding Edward&rsquo;s death. It would seem that Emily herself did not preserve the books from her father&rsquo;s time running the store.</p>

<footer><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This page is the inside back cover of volume 41 of the Mills store sales journals show the store&rsquo;s businesses expenses in the final days of E. H. Mills and the transition after Edward&rsquo;s death to M. E. Mills. These books are hardcover, cloth.</li>
<li>While typical sales are entered in the books as you would expect, the family account records start in the back and are filled in toward the front.</li>
<li>The 22 Jan 1908 entry mentions Emily Hunting, who I believe may be a reference to Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924), Emily&rsquo;s neice, whose mother was also named Mary, and so Emily&rsquo;s neice may have been called by her full middle name, &ldquo;Emily Huntting&rdquo; by family to distinguish her from her mother, just as had been done with Emily. If this is Emily&rsquo;s neice, it is the only evidence of which I am aware that the Mills in Brookton kept in active contact with family in Long Island.</li>
<li>The 23 Jan 1908 entry is presumably a reference to Ellen Gould.</li>

<footer>Notes:
- There is a reference to paying for splitting wood 19 Feb, which was quite likely done by George Jansen. Jansen&rsquo;s notebooks do cover this time period, but at that point, his notes were brief and sporadic, mainly noting weather and deaths and not going into the details of his life as later notebooks do. There are however references to George splitting wood for Emily in notebooks a decade later.</footer>
</figure>
<p>It would seem that the &ldquo;Mills Family a/c&rdquo; pages are the Mills' business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order.</p>
<p>And the Mills Family account in the months following Edward&rsquo;s death:</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that on the inside front cover of this book seems to indicate that the family purchased a barn on 23 Sep 1907 and rented it to John Roe for $0.50 a month:</p>

<p>The store was open on New Year&rsquo;s eve and New Year&rsquo;s day 1908, the day that Edward died, and we can see that Emily was working on an otherwise typical day of business at the store:</p>

<p>As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with a glimpse into their regular purchases. It is interesting to note that the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:</p>

<p>And some examples of Emily&rsquo;s own entries in the sales logs. Essentially we are getting a glimpse inside Emily and Hannah&rsquo;s pantry. Apparently, Emily had a bit of a sweet tooth: Candy was one of the more common staples:</p>

<footer>These entries show good examples of Emily&rsquo;s distinctive writing style. Notice the little dip that starts the top cross marks on her F&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s. Uppercase C&rsquo;s, E&rsquo;s and M&rsquo;s are also easily recognizable.</footer>
</figure>
<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s, we also start to see more sophisticated business records, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store&rsquo;s inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions for how to properly use them for bookkeeping.</p>

<p>The earliest formal mention of the store under Emily&rsquo;s ownership is in The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article &ldquo;Early History of Brookton Village&rdquo; in which M. E. Mills is listed as a &ldquo;present merchant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant&rsquo;s:</p>
<figure style="max-width: 700px;">
<img src="/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/section-resources/data_files/conant-gertrude-1_hue765127666cfbf8e6469d7251c4ddc99_920684_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="700" height="851" alt=" ">
<blockquote><p>Emily Mills' store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>
<p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace hankerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p>
<p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p>
<p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p>
<p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p>
<p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p>
<p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Benjamin Lockwood&rsquo;s house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, &ldquo;Dr. Mary&rdquo; Ridgway Tinker would live and practice there for a time. He was also a member of Brookton Congregational and built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920&rsquo;s. After Dr. Lockwood&rsquo;s death, E. D. Shurter placed a plaque in his honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;woman who lived in and kept house&rdquo; whose name Gertrude couldn&rsquo;t remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.</li>

<p>In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor, that Gertrude mentions.</p>
<p>“A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline” sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995 contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as “Tour 4 - P7” in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and is the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her “Note”. In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]&quot;:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-only">
<strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>
<p>This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins &amp; sewing notions sheets &amp; pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a &ldquo;sweet little lady&rdquo; who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.</p>
<p>The postoffice has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)</p>
<p>And Molly Adams, in A Note on Emily Mills tells of Emily&rsquo;s initial marketing attempts on her own:</p>
<blockquote class="quote-only">
Before David VanDeMark’s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet labeled on the outside “M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”
</blockquote>
<p>We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)</p>

Here name has several variations in spelling. In relation to the Mills store, it is consistently spelled &ldquo;La Barre&rdquo; however, Margaret did many similar store displays in which her name is consisently spelled &ldquo;LaBarr&rdquo;. The same is true of many of her mentions in the Danby gossip columns, where both &ldquo;LaBarr&rdquo; and &ldquo;LaBar&rdquo; are used. &ldquo;LaBarr&rdquo; is used in Margaret&rsquo;s own notices and advertisements: she advertised the sale of millinery supplies from her home in Danby, and she also owned a home that she rented. The intermixing of &ldquo;LaBar&rdquo; and &ldquo;LaBarr&rdquo; occur over many decades, and even her father&rsquo;s obituary spells the family name as &ldquo;LaBarr&rdquo;. Yet the grave markers say &ldquo;LABAR&rdquo; and census data consisently show spelling/capitalization of &ldquo;LaBar&rdquo;.</footer>

<p>These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890&rsquo;s to the early 190X&rsquo;s.  I could not find anything identifying the store these journals were for, but my review was merely introductory and far from exhaustive. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills store location at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, it was hoped that these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills' general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank&rsquo;s basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said &ldquo;from the Mill&rdquo; meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that would become Frank F. Mulks general store, and which would later be known to the author as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. According to the Brookton&rsquo;s Market 2011 Calendar, Vorhis owned the store from the 1880&rsquo;s to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it would become known as <strong>Frank F. Mulks</strong>. That timeframe matches up with these journals, and it would seem that the prices used in the comparisons in the calendar came from these books.</p>
<p>My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily&rsquo;s, although occassionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, perhaps even by someone who knows how to actually analyze handwriting, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to lean toward these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.</p>
