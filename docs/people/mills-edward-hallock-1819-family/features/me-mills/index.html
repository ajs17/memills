				<p>Upon moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, Edward restarted his general store, now simply <em>E. H, Mills</em>, on his own, with his son Jonas working as clerk. Emily would eventually also work as clerk in the store, taking it over upon Edward&rsquo;s death and operating it as <em>M. E. Mills</em> until her death in 1937.</p>
<p>It is really in Brookton where we get a sense of the family&rsquo;s finances through property deeds, reported estate information and the Mills store ledgers. The Mills likely always made a fairly modest, if stable, income from their small general stores.</p>
<p>This event took place at a time when Emily was identified as &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in E. H. Mills:</p>

<p><em>M. E. Mills</em> is listed as a &ldquo;present merchant&rdquo; in The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article &ldquo;Early History of Brookton Village&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.</p>
<p>These records show us how Emily&rsquo;s store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920&rsquo;s, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward&rsquo;s entries decades before, these are more modern books that also tracked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; pages to teach how to use the forms within.</p>
<p>We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic.)</p>

<p>Two articles in the Jul 14, 1934 (page 3) and Nov 20, 1934 (page  5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily &ldquo;was at lunch.&rdquo; Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendents of the accused.</p>
