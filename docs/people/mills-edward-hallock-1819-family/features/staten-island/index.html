<p>It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850&rsquo;s, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be &ldquo;of Factoryville&rdquo;. All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown>Bartlett Brown (1833 to 24 Nov 1902)</a> and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine>Charles Mills Pine (1812 to 8 Oct 1897)</a>, who may have been related to Edward through Edward&rsquo;s mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, but it&rsquo;s likely that Charles acted only as an investor, and perhaps also an adviser, in the business and was not involved in its day-to-day operation.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:400px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/1851-01-03-Brooklyn-Daily-Eagle_huc08509a5fd9474424d13eb6f45834857_43206_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=400 height=102 alt><blockquote>At Hempstead, L.

Indeed, the experiences which then came to him were invaluable, and fitted him in a superior degree for the diligent, manly and honorable life which succeeded.</p><p>He began business for himself as a coal and wood merchant in the city of Brooklyn, but later, in the year 1857, he accepted a position in the grocery store of Charles M. Pine at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleon avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family. He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.</p><p>He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home. Beside the store he had a profitable cranberry business at Calverton, L.I., which he sold to a brother two years ago.</p><p>(Partial transcription, emphasis added.

The Mills moved to Corfu sometime between the Summer of 1862 and the Spring of 1863, during a period in which the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg MD was fought just a few hundred miles southwest of Castleton, and just before the draft riots on Staten Island. Also during the early 1860’s, Bartlett Brown started a new grocery store, married, and started a family of his own, as indicated by the 1865 census:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:1000px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/staten-island/census-1865-nys-brown_hue68dd5cebd03278e85371e4ca048718a_2045320_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=1000 height=624 alt><figcaption>— <cite>1865, New York, U.S., State Census, ancestry.com.</cite><a class=origversion href=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/staten-island/census-1865-nys-brown.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure><p>As already mentioned, Charles M.
