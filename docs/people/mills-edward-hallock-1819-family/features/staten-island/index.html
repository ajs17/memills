<p>Edward and Mary Ann began their marriage in Staten Island NY where they lived throughout the 1850&rsquo;s and where all three Mills children were born. Here, Edward likely learned the grocery business from <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine>Charles Mills Pine</a> (1811 or 1812 to 8 Oct 1897), who eventually co-owned E.

Pine at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleon avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family.</strong> He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.</p><p>He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home.

For example, note the consistency over time in the bends in the road where Broadway intersects Richmond Terrace near Kill Van Kull. This area, described elsewhere as &ldquo;the bend between Van Street and Broadway&rdquo;, was the location of Pine, Hillyer & Co. general store in 1859, co-owned by Charles Pine and James Hillyer. (1930, Charles W. Leng and William T. Davis, <em>Staten Island and Its People, Volume II</em>, Lewis Historical Publishing Company Inc., NY, p651.)</p><p>If Bartlett&rsquo;s obituary is accurate, then it seems likely that in 1860, the Mills were residing with Bartlett at &ldquo;the adjoining house&rdquo; to &ldquo;the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleton Avenue&rdquo;. The Beers map from 1874 shows &ldquo;B Brown&rdquo; in the southwest corner at Broadway and Castleton, and the &ldquo;adjoining house&rdquo; would seem to be the structure at the corner of State Street and Castleton Avenue. This interpretation appears to be corroborated by the 1886 edition of Webb&rsquo;s Consolidated Directory referenced below.</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/staten-island/1874-beers-map_hue983ae5ad5e218ddc9fb57192364963a_5278618_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=549 alt><figcaption>

He was unable to do so, however, and a moment later the wagon collided with a telephone pole, throwing the driver, and a boy who was with him, to the sidewalk. Fortunately neither was injured, but the wagon-top was badly shattered. The horse continued its mad career toward Broadway, where it was caught and stopped by Bartlett Brown, Jr., who rushed out of the store when he saw it coming and seized the bit, unheading the danger of such proceeding.
