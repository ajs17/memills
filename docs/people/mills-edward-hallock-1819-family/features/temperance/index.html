				<p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomena of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p>
<p>Prior to the Mills moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, its unclear if Emily or anyone else in the family was involved in temperance.</p>

<blockquote>
Temperance groups don't appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the "Royal Templars of Temperance" who began meeting in 1878. They didn't seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.

<footer>William Ashley &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Sunday was a professional baseball player turned Presbyterian evangelist. He emphasized temperance and the cited sermon is perhaps his most famous, said to have convinced many to quit drinking. Known for being theatrical, he was one of the first preachers to make use of radio, and he was a major influence in the prohibition movement.</footer>

<footer>It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W. C. T. U. was organized in 1907, the same year that Jessie Shurter and Emily Mills were baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church. Here we see Emily listed as Superintendent of Literature and Publications. Many of her neighbors are listed beside her: Jessie Shurter (later Jessie Brewer) Mrs. Dr. B. F. Lockwood, Mrs. Daniel Mason and Anna Mulks.</footer>
