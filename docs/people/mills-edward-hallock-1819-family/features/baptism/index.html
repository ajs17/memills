				<p>7 Apr 1907, fifteen people are baptized at Brookton Congregational Church, in a service officiated by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman on one of her last visits to Brookton. Eleven of the participants, including Emily Mills, were unmarried women.</p>

<p>April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter in 1907. It was to be the final year of Edward&rsquo;s life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward&rsquo;s health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.</p>
<p>Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to Brookton to officiate. The Reverend made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in &ldquo;The Making of a Woman Minister&rdquo; in the book <strong>Enjoyment of Living</strong> by her son Max Eastman. The Church&rsquo;s historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the &ldquo;picked council&rdquo; she refers to in her account.</p>
<p>After Reverend Eastman left Brookton, she became a very prominent religious and literary figure in New York and beyond, lecturing widely and counting among her friends the Reverend Thomas Beecher, brother of Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain, for whom she wrote the eulogy for his funeral service in Elmira, but which had to be delivered by her husband due to the Reverend&rsquo;s declining health. The Reverend would die in 1910, so this would have been one of her last return visits to Brookton. So, needless to say, her presence on this day was planned well in advance by the Reverend, and it was a very significant honor that hints at a rich context to this event that we can only speculate upon now.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, Mark Twain made his last visit to Elmira that very week, attending the dedication of a new organ at Park Church in Elmira on 03 Apr 1907. His remains would be buried in Woodlawn Cemetery Elmira exactly three years later.)</p>
<p>The scripture verse used in the sermon is cited carefully, and uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.</p>

<p>I could not find an account of this baptism in the Ithaca Journal, but there is this entry over a week later in the Elmira Gazette and Free Press, that, despite some glaring inaccuracies that can be explained, appears to reference the event:</p>
<figure style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/section-resources/data_files/1907-04-17-elmira-gazette-and-free-press_hu89d5f48e1104095e3acca0f16951469a_51950_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" width="400" height="167" alt=" ">
<blockquote><p>**SOUTHSIDE PERSONALS</p>
<p>—The Rev. Annis Ford Eastman was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. R. I. Denman in Brooklyn over Sunday. She occupied the pulpit of the Congregational Church in that village and fifteen persons were received into the congregation.</p>

<footer><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brookton was often confused with Brocton and even Brooklyn, and that is the reason for adopting the name Brooktondale. (See <a href="#historical-names">Historical Names</a>) Another example can be seen in the Batavia burial notice for Jonas Mills for another example. Otherwise, the use of &ldquo;village&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</li>
<li>It is referencing the wrong weekend, but it is also a relative time reference, and perhaps the difference is just a result of the text not being updated in the time between writing and its delayed publishing.</li>
<li>The reference to the Denmans would seem to be <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338785/richard-lounsbery-denman">Richard Lounsbery Denman</a> (15 Apr 1848 to 19 Aug 1915) and his wife <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338786/adelaide-denman">Adelaide (Webster) Denman</a> (12 Sep 1852 to 30 Dec 1947). He is often referenced as R. L. Denman.</li>

<p>At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily&rsquo;s mother Mary Ann was the only one in the family on the Church rolls, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. During the Reverend&rsquo;s tenure, she would also give occasional public lectures at the Congregational Church. In the Reverend&rsquo;s account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who &ldquo;waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me.&rdquo; (From <strong>Enjoyment of Living</strong> by Max Eastman, pg 70.)</p>
<p>This is Brookton Congregational Church as it looked at the baptism that day:</p>
