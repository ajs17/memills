				<p>The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward would start E. H. Mills &amp; Co. general merchandise and dry goods with Charles Pine as one of his partners. Horace would clerk in the store for his father, and eventually commit suicide. Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.</p>
<p>The Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 19 June 1860 when the Federal Census was taken in Staten Island and June 1863 when Edward&rsquo;s Civil War Draft Registration was recorded in Genesee County:</p>

<p>In his draft registration, Edward&rsquo;s occupation is listed as &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; indicating that he may have started E. H. Mills &amp; Co. several years before the 1866 date given by Allan Starkweather, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store, which he generously provided to me in what follows:</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

<p>Allan confirms the Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists.</p>
<p>According Edward and Mary Ann&rsquo;s obituaries in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church, the Mills moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879.</p>

<blockquote><p>1908 Deaths Continued</p>
<p>Edward Hallioch[sic] Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In Mar. 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.</p>

<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo; however these seem to be errors as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rev. Woodworth&rdquo; refers to Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward&rsquo;s funeral.</li>

<li>According to Mary Ann&rsquo;s obituary–that exists elsewhere in the cited volume, and which is reproduced alongside this material–the Mills moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879, yet Mary Ann does not join the Congregational Church until a year after that date. Assuming these dates are accurate, it could suggest that perhaps Edward (and Jonas?) moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners ahead of Mary Ann and the rest of the family?</li>

<p>We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:</p>

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>
  </blockquote>

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 
<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn&rsquo;t exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.</p>
