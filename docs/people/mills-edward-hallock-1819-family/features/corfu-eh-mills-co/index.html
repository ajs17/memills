<p>The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H. Mills & Co. &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods. Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu. Horace clerked in his father’s store, and committed suicide.</p><p>The Mills, including Emily at just over one year old, are included in the 19 June 1860 Federal Census in Staten Island:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/census/census-1860-us_hu4a999a4540b7075dfc0d87f56e447ac1_1739672_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=1098 alt><figcaption>— <cite>1860, United States Federal Census, ancestry.com</cite>.<a class=origversion href=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/census/census-1860-us.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, dates that correspond with tax assessment records of the time:</p><div class=cols>

Beginning with entries recorded 01 May 1863, for district 29, division 12, and each year thereafter, there are two entries for E. H. Mills & Co. and Edward H. Mills. The 1862 document shown, recorded on 01 Sep 1862, has no such entries where they would be expected. Of course, these are just record dates, but they do give us a better defined window for when the family moved. This time period overlaps Emily&rsquo;s fourth birthday as well as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, five days after the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate invasion of Maryland that took place just 200 miles from Castleton. However, even if the above interpretation of these documents is correct, it could still very well be that the family moved as early as the Summer of 1862.</p><p>There is also a June 1863 Civil War Draft Registration record in Genesee County for Edward where his occupation was listed as &ldquo;merchant&rdquo;:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/1863-edward-civil-war-draft_huad0aa3e98be9e835067b4636109b6c75_502261_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=533 alt><figcaption>— <cite>Jun 1863, U.S., Civil War Draft Registrations Records, 1863-1865, ancestry.com</cite>.<a class=origversion href=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/1863-edward-civil-war-draft.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure><p>As can be seen in the 1863 tax assessment documents, the Mills&rsquo; store is entered as &ldquo;Mills E. H. & Co.&rdquo;, showing that it was already operating by 01 May 1863, several years before the 1866 date given by Allan Starkweather in the following account, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store, which he generously provided to me in what follows:</p><figure class=quote-only>
<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu. It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899. It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services.

Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p><p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W.

</figcaption></figure><p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:</p><figure class=quote-only>
<blockquote>
<h4>Congregationalist Church</h4><p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."
</p><p>
When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.
</p><h4>Presbyterian Church</h4><p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
</p><p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s. Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society.
</p><p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.
