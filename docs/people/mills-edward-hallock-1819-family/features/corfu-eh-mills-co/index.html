				<p>The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, would start E. H. Mills &amp; Co. &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods. Horace would clerk in the store for his father, and eventually commit suicide. Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.</p>
<p>The Mills, including Emily at just over one year old, are included in the 19 June 1860 Federal Census in Staten Island:</p>

<p>Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, dates that correspond with tax assessment records of the time:</p>

<p>The tax assessments are divided by &ldquo;districts&rdquo; then further subdivided into &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; at which point, individuals and businesses are listed together alphabetically. Beginning with entries recorded 01 May 1863, for district 29, division 12, and each year thereafter, there are two entries for E. H. Mills &amp; Co. and Edward H. Mills. The 1862 document shown, recorded on 01 Sep 1862, has no such entries where they would be expected. Of course, these are just record dates, but they do give us a better defined window for when the family moved. This time period overlaps Emily&rsquo;s fourth birthday as well as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, five days after the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate invasion of Maryland that took place just 200 miles from Castleton. However, even if we are interpreting the meaning of these documents correctly, it could still very well be that the family moved as early as the Summer of 1862.</p>
<p>There is also a June 1863 Civil War Draft Registration record in Genesee County for Edward where his occupation was listed as &ldquo;merchant&rdquo;:</p>

<p>As can be seen in the 1863 tax assessment documents, the Mills store is entered as &ldquo;Mills E. H. &amp; Co.&rdquo;, showing that it was already operating by 01 May 1863, several years before the 1866 date given by Allan Starkweather in the following account, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store, which he generously provided to me in what follows:</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

<p>I believe that James <em>M.</em> Hillyer may be an error, albeit, one that is repeated, but this is the only record I have of a James <em>M.</em> Hillyer in Corfu or Staten Island. I believe this may be James <em>A.</em> Hillyer, who is another grocer in Staten Island closely associated with Charles Pine for many years.</p>

<p>The fact that James Hillyer was a subscriber to the directory somewhat weakens my theory that this is a mistake, but I still think that this is the more likely explanation, but far from proven.</p>
<p>From the documents available to me, that include city directories and census data, I see no evidence that James Hillyer or Charles Pine ever lived in Corfu, and I get the sense that they were probably more in the role of investors and possibly advisors and likely not involved in the day-to-day operations of the store.  For more information on Charles Pine and James Hillyer, see <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/staten-island/">The Mills Family in Staten Island</a>.</p>
<p>The following map images and associated business directories show both the E. H. Mills &amp; Co. general store as well as the Mills' home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876. E. H. Mills &amp; Co. was also referred to, on these maps and directories at least, as &ldquo;Mills Cash Store&rdquo; or just simply &ldquo;Cash Store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Allan confirms the Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists.</p>
<p>According Edward and Mary Ann&rsquo;s obituaries in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church, the Mills moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879.</p>

<blockquote><p>1908 Deaths Continued</p>
<p>Edward Hallioch[sic] Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In Mar. 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.</p>

<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo; however these seem to be errors as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rev. Woodworth&rdquo; refers to Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward&rsquo;s funeral.</li>

<li>According to Mary Ann&rsquo;s obituary–that exists elsewhere in the cited volume, and which is reproduced alongside this material–the Mills moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1879, yet Mary Ann does not join the Congregational Church until a year after that date. Assuming these dates are accurate, it could suggest that perhaps Edward (and Jonas?) moved to Mott&rsquo;s Corners ahead of Mary Ann and the rest of the family?</li>

<blockquote><p><strong>DEATH OF MRS. E. H. MILLS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event occurred in Brookton, Tompkins County—Interrment at Corfu.</strong></p>
<p>Corfu, Dec 31.—The remains of Mrs. E. H. Mills of Brookton, Tompkins county, arrived here on the 4:26 p. m. train yesterday and were interred in Evergreen Hill Cemetery. The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.</p>

<blockquote><p>WILLIAM W. M&rsquo;GREGOR.</p>
<p>Death of an Aged and Highly Esteemed Resident of Corfu.</p>
<p>Corfu, Nov. 6.—William W. MacGregor, an old and highly esteemed resident of Corfu, died at 3:30 o’clock yesterday morning from the infirmities of age. He had been in very good health and walked down town nearly every day until a month ago, when he fell and had not been well since. His mental faculties were somewhat impaired.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor was born in London, Eng., on October 10, 1822, and in April 1851, came to America, going first to Akron, then Pavilion and coming to Corfu nearly fifty years ago. On April 19, 1856, he married Lucy Ann Sumner, who died on May 18, 1910. In September 1910, the only surviving member of his immediate family, his sister, Miss Sophia MacGregor, left her home in Sussex, Eng., to come to America for the first time, to make her home with her brother. She is 83 years of age. Besides his sister Mr. MacGregor leaves several nephews and nieces.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor was apprenticed as a saddler in Perth, Scotland, and continued as a harness maker in this country until April 1900, when he sold his business at Corfu to M. L. Hanford. He was secretary of the Evergreen Hill Cemetery Association when it was organized on February 9, 1978, and was its treasurer for many years, resigning from that office six years ago. He had served as justice and had been town clerk, village clerk and notary public. He was a member of the Presbyterian church.</p>
<p>In a letter written to his sister on March 18, 1851, from Edinburgh, Scotland, Mr. MacGregor said: “On the 28th of this month I sail from Greenock for New York in the ship ‘Adonis.’ You know I long wished to emigrate and now the time has come. My berth is taken and part of my passage paid. The ‘Adonis’ is a very large vessel, 1,200 tons burden, and will take out a great many emigrants, I believe two or three hundred. I have taken what is called an immediate passage which costs four pounds.”</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor’s funeral will be held from the house at 3:30 o’clock tomorrow afternoon. The interment will be in the Evergreen Hill cemetery.</p>

<p>We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:</p>

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:</p>
<figure class="quote-only">
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4>
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 
<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn&rsquo;t exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.</p>
