This area provides an unusual survival of a small agricultural community once common on Long Island. The prosperity of the Mills family is evident from this substantial Greek Revival house built for William Wickham Mills in 1838-40. Designed by New York City architect, Calvin Pollard, the house is one of the few high-style structures of this period on Long Island. The extensive original documentation which remains in a family collection provides an unusually complete picture of the construction of a mid 19th century house.”</aside></figure></p><figure class=quote-only>
<blockquote>
In an elegant old home on North Country Road in St. James, visitors can find the impressive art gallery of the Smithtown Township Arts Council. The structure, known as the Mills Pond House, holds the work of talented artists and also represents a piece of Smithtown history.
<p>It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder&rsquo;s sons in 1693, according to &ldquo;Colonel Rockwell&rsquo;s Scrap-Book&rdquo; published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.</p><p>In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council&rsquo;s website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.</p><p>The original house that was built by Timothy Mills before 1700 was partially destroyed by a fire, according to &ldquo;Colonel Rockwell&rsquo;s Scrap-book&rdquo;. William Wickham Mills, a descendant of Timothy, restored the damaged part of the house and built a three-story addition in 1838.</p><p>Smithtown historian Bradley Harris said William Wickham Mills was one of the richest men in Suffolk County. He was a farmer and also a prominent landlord owning a large amount of land in Smithtown&rsquo;s Landing area. William Wickham Mills also served as Town Supervisor of Smithtown from 1838 – 1841.</p><p>According to the arts council website, a noted New York City architect by the name of Calvin Pollard designed the Mills Pond House. An example of Grecian design, materials such as English glass, Connecticut stone and Santo Domingo mahogany were used contributing to its elegance.</p><p>Harris said, &ldquo;It was the most magnificent house in Smithtown.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the scrap-book, in 1846 a daughter of William Wickham Mills married into Smithtown&rsquo;s Smith family. When he died in 1865, his grandson Dubois Smith inherited the home and land. It was later passed on to Dubois Smith&rsquo;s two daughters Josephine and Mildred Smith, who donated the house to the Town of Smithtown in 1976.</p><p>Soon after the donation of the home to the town, the Smithtown Township Arts Council has been using the Mills Pond House to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages.</p><p>Despite modern adaptations such as gallery lighting and handicap access, the structure has remained basically unchanged. Visitors to the home can still find formal porticoes and marble mantelpieces.</p><p>The regal Mills Pond House provides the perfect location to expose Smithtown residents to art and also reminds us of a noted local family and our rich history.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

<li>Emily&rsquo;s and Hannah&rsquo;s birthdates was well as the birth places for Hannah, Emily, Jonas and Horace are based on census entries.</li><li>Jonas Davis Mills and Mary Platt Mills may be related, although I have yet to follow up on this.</li><li>The only source of Horace&rsquo;s exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.</li><li>Edward&rsquo;s middle name Hallock was his Mother&rsquo;s maiden name. Although most typically spelled &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; there are occasionally alternate spellings of this name in the Mills and Hallock genealogies, such as &ldquo;Halliock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo;.

There were lots of variants on the Hallock name, and sometimes different descendants used different spellings.&rdquo; (personal correspondence, 21 Jul 2021)</li><li>It appears Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily may get her middle name from Edward&rsquo;s sister who passed over decade before Emily was born.</li></ul><p>Several of the marriages above and below are referenced, if not corroborated, in the volume <em>Early marriage records of the Mills family in the United States : official and authoritative records of Mills marriages in the original states and colonies from 1628 to 1865</em> published in 1916 by William Montgomery Clemens, accessed via ancestry.com:</p><div class=cols>

The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square. It is rumored that the name is in honor of Benjamin Franklin.&rdquo;</li><li>Note that this references prior publication of this notice in the Hempstead Sentinel, so there is some chance of finding more legible text.

Thomas Mills) NOT Thomas James Mills</strong>. The confusion with the name may arise because it seems, based on the obituary for his son Watts, that J. Thomas Mills may have commonly gone by Thomas, and in some census records, it does appear that his name is written as Thomas J.</p><p>1827 as James&rsquo; birth year is corroborated by multiple sources, and would suggest that his birth had something to do with his mother&rsquo;s death a few weeks later. So, he was Edward&rsquo;s younger brother, not older. J. Thomas Mills&rsquo; obituary suggests that either the family moved around a bit (see Jonas&rsquo; obituary below), and/or perhaps Edward&rsquo;s purported birthplace is not Smithtown, but was assumed to be at some point. Also, the fact that the month of Jonas and Mary Hallock&rsquo;s marriage is disputed may be a clue of some kind, as December would mean that Edward was conceived before his parents were married, February would not.

Thomas Mills.</p><p>One of Huntington&rsquo;s oldest and most highly respected residents, J. Thomas Mills, passed away early Thursday morning, at the age of 88 years. He had suffered several strokes of paralysis, and had failed gradually since the last attack, some ten days ago.</p><p>Mr. Mills was not born in Suffolk County, but he was only two weeks and two days old when he first came to old Suffolk. He first saw the light of day at Cherry street, New York City, February 13, 1827. He was the son of Jonas D. Mills and Mary Hallock, a Smithtown woman, and before he was three weeks old, his parents came up to Smithtown on a large sailing vessel, to make their home. When young Mills was 18 years of age his people apprenticed him to Samuel Scudder, in this village, to learn the tailoring trade. The shop was over the Huntington House, where many of the dandies of two generations ago secured the latest cut garments. The young man stayed with Scudder until he was married to Ann Eliza, daughter of Barney Manney, in 1848, when he secured a more lucrative position with Jonas Pearsall at the same business. After some five or six years at the Pearsall shop he gave up the trade and assisted his father-in-law, who had a nice farm at Long Swamp (as it was then called) at farming and team work. In 1871 Mr. Mills took the position as sexton of the Huntington Rural Cemetery, which place he faithfully held until 1905.</p><p>Huntington has changed most wonderfully since the time Mr. Mills plied the needle in the local tailoring shops. Then on the south side of Main street the principal buildings were Shepard&rsquo;s bakery, Hopper&rsquo;s hat store, Scudder&rsquo;s general country store, a shoe shop and the Suffolk Hotel, while a large locust-grove stood on the present site of the Brush block and Central Church property. On the other side of the street the principal structures were the Zophar Oakley store, near the site of the present Stevens block; Jonas Pearsall&rsquo;s tailoring shop, where the Goldstein store is now located; Isaac Adams&rsquo; tinshop, where stands the First National Bank; the Huntington House, kept by Samuel Scudder, now conducted by A. Finnegan, and the residences of George A Scudder and Daniel Sammis.</p><p>Eight children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Mills, of whom four are living. Mrs. Mills passed away in 1880. They are: George, Alonzo, Watts and Clarissa, the widow of Edward Etsell, all of this place.</p><p>The funeral services will be held at the home of his son, George Mills, on Wall street, with whom he lived, Saturday, at 2 o&rsquo;clock, in charge of the Rev. Samuel H. Seem, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, of which deceased was a member. The interment will be in the Huntington Rural Cemetery.</p></blockquote><figcaption>

Death was instantaneous.</p><p>The accident occurred in front of the Methodist Church on Main street, next door to which Mrs. Cross lived. She had boarded the bus at the railroad station, on her return from Kings Park.</p><p>The bus was operated by Kenneth Smith with Alfred Whittaker as conductor. The bus halted at the regulation stop in front of the church. Whittaker, as is his custom, stepped off the bus and assisted several passengers to the street. Mrs. Cross was the last to leave. When all was clear Whittaker stepped back into the bus which started slowly off.</p><p>The entrance and exit of the bus is at the front on the right side and it was necessary for Mrs. Cross to wait for the bus to pass to cross over to her home. When she left the bus Miss Cross walked a short distance in the opposite direction and then turned back and suddenly fell. It was thought at first she may have slipped on ice but at this particular place where the accident occurred was clear, and it is possible she was taken with a fainting spell. Coroner W. B. Gibson was notified.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Cross had spent Christmas Day with Mrs. Cross&rsquo; mother, Mrs Chatfield Smith at Kings Park and Mr. Cross returned home that night, but his wife remained. Mrs. Cross leaves three brothers, residents of Kings Park, J. Willis, Edgar and Henry.</p></blockquote><figcaption>
