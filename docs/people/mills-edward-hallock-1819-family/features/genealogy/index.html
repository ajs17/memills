<p>Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown on Long Island and to this day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)">Mills Pond District</a> is named for them:</p>
 <figure class="quote-only">
 <blockquote>
It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.
<p>In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council&rsquo;s website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.</p>

<p>Edward H. Mills has partial entries on at least two Mills family genealogies:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York</em> at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, an archived version exists, and I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. This genealogy is dated 07 Aug 2003.</li>

<p>And to these genealogies, we can add Edward&rsquo;s branch to its ultimate conclusion:</p>
<p><span>1030.</span> <strong>Edward Hallock Mills</strong> (born Smithtown NY, 25 Mar 1819, died Brookton NY, 01 Jan 1908).</p>
<p>Edward married (1) <strong>Mary Ann (Pine) Mills</strong> (born Hempstead NY, 08 Feb 1819, died Brookton NY, 28 Dec 1895). Married on 29 Dec 1850.</p>
<p>Children:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jonas E. Mills</strong> (born Staten Island NY, 1852, died Brookton NY, 14 Oct 1885).</li>
<li><strong>Horace F. Mills</strong> (born Staten Island NY, 1854, died Corfu NY, 27 Oct 1876).</li>
<li><strong>Mary Emily Mills</strong> who went by &ldquo;Emily&rdquo; and often signed her name as &ldquo;M. Emily Mills&rdquo; (born Staten Island NY, Dec 1858, died Brooktondale NY, 03 Nov 1937).</li>
</ul>
<p>None of Edward&rsquo;s children married or had children.</p>
<p>Edward married (2) <strong>Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills</strong> (born England, 21 May 1824, died Brookton NY, 12 Feb 1917). Married on 30 Dec 1896.</p>
<ul>
<li>No children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emily&rsquo;s and Hannah&rsquo;s birthdates was well as the birth places for Hannah, Emily, Jonas and Horace are based on census entries. The birthdates in particular are based on the 1900 census, which contradict Emily&rsquo;s gravestone.</li>
<li>Edward&rsquo;s parents were married while Edward was in utero (at least according to one of the dates given) and his older brother Thomas was already a toddler.</li>
<li>Jonas Davis Mills and Mary Platt Mills appear to be relatives, although I have followed this through to be sure.</li>
<li>The only source of Horace&rsquo;s exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.</li>
<li>Edward&rsquo;s middle name Hallock was his Mother&rsquo;s maiden name. Although most typically spelled &ldquo;Hallock&rdquo; there are occasionally alternate spellings of this name in the Mills and Hallock genealogies, such as &ldquo;Halliock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo;. According to Hallockville Farm Museum board member and historian Richard Wines &ldquo;Spelling was flexible back in the day. There were lots of variants on the Hallock name, and sometimes different descendants used different spellings.&rdquo; (personal correspondence, 21 Jul 2021)</li>
<li>It would appear that Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily would appear to get her name from Edward&rsquo;s sister who passed over decade before Emily was born.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/mills-home-brooktondale/">Mills home deeds</a> from the time of Emily&rsquo;s death list the following as cousins of Emily&rsquo;s as possible heirs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alonzo Mills</li>
<li>George E. Mills</li>
<li>Clarissa Etsall</li>
<li>Mary Huntting Smith</li>
</ul>
<p>Mary Huntting Smith may be a reference to Emily&rsquo;s neice, or a descendent of Emily&rsquo;s neice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edwards&rsquo;s sister Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting (1821–1849) married John Smith Huntting (1817–1893),</li>
<li>their child Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938), named after their Grandmother, married Henry Chatfield Smith (1843–1896),</li>
<li>their child Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924), Emily&rsquo;s neice, married: James M. Cross.</li>
</ul>
<p>She appears to be referenced in the sales records of the <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/">Mills store</a> by her full middle name &ldquo;Emily Huntting&rdquo;. She was killed in a strange accident with a bus in front of her home:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bus Kills Woman Said To Be Dazed</p>
<p>Northport, L. I., Dec. 27—Mrs. Mary Cross, 49, wife of James Cross, is dead at her home here today as the result of an unusual accident. She was run over by a local bus and, according to Dr. Roger Dexter, died instantly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cross returned last evening from Kings Park, where she had visited her mother and brothers over Christmas. Other Northport passengers on the train from Kings Park say she gave indications of being dazed. She took the bus a the local station and descended from it before her home. She took two steps away from the vehicle then turned and walked into it. She plunged under the rear wheel as the vehicle started off.</p>
<p>The bus was driven by Kenneth Smith, assisted by George Whittaker.</p>

<blockquote><p>Woman Is Killed, Run Over By Bus</p>
<p>Northport Victim, Returning From Visit, Slipped as She Left Vehicle to Enter Home Nearby.</p>
<p>Northport, Dec. 27—Mrs. Mary Cross, aged 49, wife of James Cross, was killed yesterday afternoon about 1 o&rsquo;clock when she fell underneath a bus of the Northport Traction Company, the rear wheel passing over her head.</p>
<p>Dr. Roger Dexter, whose office is nearby, was called. Death was instantaneous.</p>
<p>The accident occurred in front of the Methodist Church on Main street, next door to which Mrs. Cross lived. She had boarded the bus at the railroad station, on her return from Kings Park.</p>
<p>The bus was operated by Kenneth Smith with Alfred Whittaker as conductor. The bus halted at the regulation stop in front of the church. Whittaker, as is his custom, stepped off the bus and assisted several passengers to the street. Mrs. Cross was the last to leave. When all was clear Whittaker stepped back into the bus which started slowly off.</p>
<p>The entrance and exit of the bus is at the front on the right side and it was necessary for Mrs. Cross to wait for the bus to pass to cross over to her home. When she left the bus Miss Cross walked a short distance in the opposite direction and then turned back and suddenly fell. It was thought at first she may have slipped on ice but at this particular place where the accident occurred was clear, and it is possible she was taken with a fainting spell. Coroner W. B. Gibson was notified.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Cross had spent Christmas Day with Mrs. Cross' mother, Mrs Chatfield Smith at Kings Park and Mr. Cross returned home that night, but his wife remained. Mrs. Cross leaves three brothers, residents of Kings Park, J. Willis, Edgar and Henry.</p>
