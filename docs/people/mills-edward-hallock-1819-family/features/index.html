<h2><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/>E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills General Stores</a></h2><div class=meta>
<time>Tuesday 24 May 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>After moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1889, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills from 1909 until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jesse Brewer took over the store and ran it under her name for many years, primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back. In 1961, Charles Vorhis purchased the building and moved the post office there from what is presently known as Brookton&rsquo;s Market. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road. At present, the location is commonly known as &ldquo;the old postoffice&rdquo;.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/ class=more-link>read more</a>

</div><div class=content><p>Before calling Mott&rsquo;s Corners home, the Mills moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H. Mills & Co. &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; offering general merchandise and dry goods.

<time>Saturday 21 May 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/temperance/ class=more-link>read more</a>

<time>Wednesday 18 May 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>Although there is likely no direct connection between the two families, it is interesting to note that there are a number of Hallocks in the Danby and Caroline area coinciding with the Mills&rsquo; time in the area. But obviously, if these Hallocks are related to Edward&rsquo;s mother, it would certainly suggest reasons why Edward chose to move the family to Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/caroline-hallocks/ class=more-link>read more</a>
