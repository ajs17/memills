<div>
<p>Upon moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners, Edward restarted his general store, now simply <em>E. H, Mills</em>, on his own, with his son Jonas working as clerk. Emily would eventually also work as clerk in the store, taking it over upon Edward&rsquo;s death and operating it as <em>M. E. Mills</em> until her death in 1937.</p>

<div>
<p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomena of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p>

<div>
<p>The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward would start E. H. Mills &amp; Co. general merchandise and dry goods with Charles Pine as one of his partners. Horace would clerk in the store for his father, and eventually commit suicide. Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/staten-island/">The Mills Family in Staten Island NY</a></h2>
    <div class="meta">

    </div>
	
<div>
<p>It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850&rsquo;s, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be &ldquo;of Factoryville&rdquo;. All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown">Bartlett Brown (1833-24 Nov 1902)</a> and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine">Charles M. Pine (1812-8 Oct 1897)</a>, who may have been related to Edward through Edward&rsquo;s mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills &amp; Co. in Corfu, and it would appear that Charles likely acted only as an investor in the business and was not likely to be involved in its day-to-day operation.</p>

Genealogy Edward H. Mills has partial entries on at least two Mills family genealogies:
 Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, an archived version exists, and I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. This genealogy is dated 07 Aug 2003.

Physical Artifacts Remaining The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this.
There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter House next door (the Shurter House sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton).
