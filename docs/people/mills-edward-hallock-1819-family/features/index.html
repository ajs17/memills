<h2><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/>E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills General Stores</a></h2><div class=meta>
<time>Saturday 26 Mar 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>After moving to Mott&rsquo;s Corners in Mar 1889, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Both Jonas and Emily clerked at E. H. Mills. Emily took over the store after Edward&rsquo;s death and operated it under the name M. E. Mills until her death in 1937. Soon thereafter, Jesse Brewer took over the store and ran it for many years under her name, after which, the building became the location of the post office. The Mills&rsquo; store structure survives today and is located at 484 Brooktondale Road.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/ class=more-link>read more</a>

<h2><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/temperance/>Temperance Activity</a></h2><div class=meta>
<time>Saturday 26 Mar 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>The temperance movement was a significant cultural phenomenon of the mid 1800&rsquo;s to the early 1900&rsquo;s, and was particularly strong among the religious communities of upstate NY. There was significant overlap between members of the temperance movement and those supporting suffrage, and before that, abolition. Emily, Hannah and Ellen were all active in temperance.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/temperance/ class=more-link>read more</a>

</div><div class=content><p>The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860&rsquo;s where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, started E. H.

<h2><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/staten-island/>The Mills Family in Staten Island NY</a></h2><div class=meta>
<time>Sunday 27 Mar 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850&rsquo;s, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be &ldquo;of Factoryville&rdquo;. All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown>Bartlett Brown (1833 to 24 Nov 1902)</a> and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine>Charles Mills Pine (1812 to 8 Oct 1897)</a>, who may have been related to Edward through Edward&rsquo;s mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, but it&rsquo;s likely that Charles acted only as an investor, and perhaps also an adviser, in the business and was not involved in its day-to-day operation.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/staten-island/ class=more-link>read more</a>

<time>Saturday 26 Mar 2022</time>
</div><div class=content><p>This research was made possible by the generosity of many people who have offered their time, access to their materials and access to their knowledge, to allow me to start putting together the puzzle pieces of Emily&rsquo;s life. I apologize to those I have forgotten; these I recall in no particular order: Molly Adams, Donna Eschenbrenner, Barbara Kone, Allan Starkweather, Ken Rumble, Richard Wines, Margaret Wegener, Ted Sobel, Becky Dewitt, Sarah Michelle, Ralph Conant, Carol Coggshall, Lois Lounsbery, Bea Raponi, Emily Adams, Bill Besemer, Mike Scaglione, Elaine Sapp, Pastor Kayti Dean and the council of Caroline Valley Community Church. And those throughout the years who preserved precious memories: Gertrude Contant, E. D. Shurter, and Jessie Brewer.</p><a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/research/ class=more-link>read more</a>
