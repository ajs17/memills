      <description>Temperance groups don&#39;t appear to be very strong here. The only mention I found was the &#34;Royal Templars of Temperance&#34; who began meeting in 1878. They didn&#39;t seem to be very powerful. No date was given as to when they ceased to exist.   — Personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian    — Apr 30, 1886 Quarterly Returns for Independent Order of Good Templars High Bridge Lodge No.</description>
