<p>This research was made possible by the generosity of many people who have offered their time, access to their materials and access to their knowledge, to allow me to start putting together the puzzle pieces of Emily&rsquo;s life. I apologize to those I have forgotten; these I recall in no particular order: Molly Adams, Barbara Kone, Allan Starkweather, Al Chafee, Donna Eschenbrenner, Ken Rumble, Richard Wines, Margaret Wegener, Bea Szekely, Ted Sobel, Becky Dewitt, Sarah Michelle, Ralph Conant, Carol Coggshall, Alanna Congdon, Rob Bernhardt, Lois Lounsbery, Bea Raponi, Emily Adams, Bill Besemer, Mike Scaglione, Elaine Sapp, Pastor Kayti Dean and the council of Caroline Valley Community Church. And those throughout the years who preserved precious memories: Gertrude Conant, E. D. Shurter, and Jessie Brewer.</p><hr>
<p>Someone might someday wonder about my interest in Emily. I often wonder about it too.</p><p>When I came to Brooktondale, I valued the time as the beginning of a new phase of my life, but I did not intend to stay forever.</p><p>Shortly after I moved in, Molly Adams sought me out and handed me &ldquo;A Note on Emily Mills.&rdquo; I took it and read it with some interest, and appreciated it enough at the time to put the document with my deeds and file it away. I&rsquo;m sure it didn&rsquo;t take long at all for me to forget that it existed. What a wasted opportunity! I never got the chance to ask Molly for more information, yet her words have been, and remain, invaluable to me. Presumably, if she had a photo of Emily, she would have given me that too, as I later learned that Molly kept an eye out for newcomers (as she herself had once been) to educate them about their homes and the people that occupied them in the past. I have since learned just how passionate Molly was about history in general, and Brooktondale&rsquo;s history in particular. She was clearly a rare individual, and we owe so much to her.</p><p>I had absorbed enough of Brooktondale&rsquo;s history early on, through materials I read while eating dinners at the Market, to recognize the significance of the designation &ldquo;Brookton&rdquo; when I first saw it elsewhere. My father decided to wait until I had lived in the Ithaca area for two decades before telling me that we had ancestors buried in the area, and that he might someday want to find them again. I suggested that I could help by looking it up online, and after a very quick search, I was surprised to find a listing in East Hill Cemetery for the Rev. James Richards Robinson, with a note that he died in Brookton in 1914, and I informed my father of the coincidence. With the generous help of the manager at the cemetery, I was able to send my father photographs of the graves and cemetery records. It wasn&rsquo;t until a few years after my father died that I learned that the Reverend had significant materials preserved in the Cornell Library archives. Another wasted opportunity.</p><p>Family history interested me, but it always seemed like such an enormous topic to undertake, and I was of course busy trying to make something of myself as my father might phrase it. But I decided that maybe someday I could try to just answer a simple, but relevant question: Had my Great Great Grandfather been a visitor inside my home? I didn&rsquo;t expect to find proof, but maybe I could find a connection that would make it more likely at least. Perhaps if the residents of my home at the time were members of his congregation? Perhaps even prominent, active members of the congregation? I eventually answered these questions to my satisfaction: it seems quite probable he had.</p><p>After living in Brooktondale for just over a decade, I was reaching a point where I needed to start planning for the next, presumably final, phase of my life, and I had always had definite ideas of what that might look like, and it involved moving away from Brooktondale. I was still in the early stages of this planning, while walking home from Brookton&rsquo;s Market in the fading twilight, and reflecting on how much I had done during my time in Brooktondale, and how much I had changed as a person since my arrival, that when I arrived back at my home, I finally caught a glimpse of the obvious truth: I could never bring myself to leave this place.</p><p>For the first time, I truly began to see Brooktondale as my home, and I finally allowed myself to fall in love with what I came to know as &ldquo;The Mills&rsquo; Place&rdquo;. I began investing heavily in my home and its improvement, in ways that seemed impractical before. I expended not only money, but my own physical effort, as I began teaching myself skills to properly care for her. The home is very quirky, very challenging in many ways, but I learned her ways and how to work with her. As I was doing this, I also tried to become more involved in community activities and charities, and also for the first time, I started to meet people beyond my immediate neighbors.</p><p>Naturally, there came a time when I wanted to learn more about the object of my love. I began to appreciate that I was just a link in a chain of people who shaped my home, and that in turn, my decisions will impact those who will care for her in the future. And so, to learn about my home, it seemed logical to learn about the former owners who shaped it before me.</p><p>I suppose I naively thought that after sending a quick message to the Town Historian (Barbara Kone who has been so patient and helpful), she would respond later that day with a complete synopsis of the home, including photos and brief biographies of all the former owners! I would then create some kind of artwork based on this information to hang on my wall, as a way to honor those who came before me. This was the extent of my planning. Of course, I quickly came to understand how wildly unrealistic any expectations like that were. So little is left behind of anyone&rsquo;s life, we are so quickly forgotten. What little information survives is messy and often challenging to understand. And how tragic it would have been if I had been given this information so easily, as that would have likely satisfied my curiosity, perhaps forever, and I would never take this journey myself. As I have often found to be the case, and what is a truism of life in general I suppose: if I wanted this knowledge, I had to discover it myself, and that really is the best way anyway. And once I began, I was surprised to discover a new passion.</p><p>I remembered my question about my Great Great Grandfather, and decided that the intersection of these two paths made a logical starting point. I had my deeds, and looked up the owners at that time: Edward, Hannah and Emily Mills. And of course, I re-discovered the history of the kind that I had been hoping for: A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams. Molly had passed several years earlier, but with my deeds and her Note as a starting point, I quickly realized that to know my home, I had to learn about the Mills, and in particular, Emily, as she lived in the home the longest of anyone by far. I can now appreciate that more information exists about Emily than I could reasonably expect to find, yet it is human nature to want what we don&rsquo;t have, and after I made some initial inquiries for photos and learned there were none known to exist, gazing upon Emily&rsquo;s face became my greatest desire.</p><p>This material is my first attempt to learn about my home and to honor the Mills family, especially Emily. And what an amazing journey it has been! To learn about Emily, I had to start learning about Brookton at the time, and the people in her community, all of which are subjects of endless fascination. The era of Brookton was a special time and place, overflowing with interesting people whose stories are much more compelling than any Hollywood entertainment. I now appreciate why the first question every long-time Caroline resident asks me is: &ldquo;How long have you lived here?&rdquo; (Eventually, when these same people asked where I lived, I could offer my own challenge: &ldquo;If I told you I lived in The Mills&rsquo; Place, would you know where that is?&rdquo; That piece of once-common knowledge had been forgotten.)</p><p>I am certainly not the person Emily would have chosen to care for her home and family memories. (It was well after I left the Finger Lakes Beer Trail that I learned the irony.) But Emily and I are now forever connected to one another, in ways that are deeply personal, and which I choose to keep private.</p><p>I am no historian, and so the limitations of my abilities are severe. What I present here is something more like a online scrapbook. My goals are simple: to discover, make visible, and help preserve, all surviving information on Edward&rsquo;s family, for Caroline residents and Mills descendants who may be interested in this little rural family. I am leaving behind breadcrumbs in the hopes that others with better skills can fill in the many gaps. If I never see Emily&rsquo;s face, maybe someday others will find her. Emily, her family, and her neighbors lived lives worth remembering.</p><p>I ask any Mills family descendants, or descendants of old Brookton residents who may discover this site, please review any materials you have and share with me anything you may have related to Edward&rsquo;s family at asmith607 at gmail dot com for possible inclusion in these materials. Even photos with unidentified people in them may be helpful in my search for Emily.</p><p>Thank you for your interest.</p><p>Adam Smith, 26 Dec 2021</p><h2 id=physical-artifacts-remaining>Physical Artifacts Remaining</h2><p>The original structures of both the Mills&rsquo; store in Brooktondale and the Mills&rsquo; home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this.</p><p>There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills&rsquo; store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter House next door (the Shurter House sat between the Mills&rsquo; store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton). Any photos taken from the parking lot of Mulks&rsquo; store looking southwest should be examined closely for the Mills&rsquo; store in the background across the street.</p><p>In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills&rsquo; home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, I have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and I will be able to get a better look at it. I am also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in Gertrude&rsquo;s materials.</p><p>Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills&rsquo; home in 1866. Neither of those structures survive today.</p><p>Significant amounts of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting spanning many decades survives:</p><ul>
<li>A notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880&rsquo;s. A number of entries are written in Emily&rsquo;s hand while she was secretary. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization written by her. These items are kept in the Tompkins County History Center archives.</li><li>Volumes of sales journals of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920&rsquo;s were salvaged from the basement of the Mills&rsquo; store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The journals are in excellent condition, and Emily&rsquo;s handwriting is easily matched to the known examples from the Good Templars meeting notes. &ldquo;No. 41&rdquo; is the most important as it shows the time and some details around Edward&rsquo;s death.</li></ul><p>The Tompkins County History Center archives also has at least two examples of postmarks that bear Edward&rsquo;s name: &ldquo;E. H. Mills, P. M.&rdquo;. Interestingly, these are envelopes with attached correspondence showing it was Good Templars business and associated with Emily. I have also purchased a few examples of similar postmarked envelopes sold online by stamp collectors. Images for all of these postmarks are included elsewhere in this publication.</p><p><em>A Note on Emily Mills</em>, mentions &ldquo;a little leatherette booklet&rdquo; with M. E. Mills printed on it, and Molly&rsquo;s research notes indicate that this item was donated to the Caroline History Room in Mar 2002, but as of an inquiry in 2021, it could not be located.</p><p>A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois (E. D. Shurter) and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.</p><p>The Good Templars items at the Tompkins County History Center appear to be most closely associated with Emily&rsquo;s activities, so it seems logical that the trail of custody of the Good Templars items, and possibly a number of others at the Center, such as the 1917 W.C.T.U. directory, may be traced back to Emily: I believe it quite likely that these were all her possessions, kept for many decades, that came into Jessie Brewer&rsquo;s possession when she purchased Emily&rsquo;s property at auction in 1938. Then, as Jessie went through Emily&rsquo;s things, she took special care to save these remembrances of her old friends, and Emily in particular, and the very personal keepsake of her handwriting. If my theory is correct (which is admittedly impossible to know), it suggests a deep affection between these two women, who were neighbors for many decades and who shared so much. Upon her death, Jessie Brewer made a significant donation to the public library in Dryden which seems worthy of further investigation.</p><p>If you review the boxes of W.C.T.U. directories, you will see that one book in particular is oddly out of place: a 1917 directory that is unique, as most of the others are from the 1930&rsquo;s and after. This is intriguing for a few reasons: 1917 is the year Hannah died, and as she was a very highly regarded member, there is some chance of a connection there, although that may be a stretch. But also consider that the 1917 book is the only one that I found (after an admittedly modest review of the books from Emily&rsquo;s lifetime, given the access and time constraints) that explicitly documents Emily as a member. The coincidence seems potentially significant.</p><h2 id=information-yet-to-be-incorporated>Information Yet To Be Incorporated</h2><p>Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:</p><ul>
<li>finish Temperance activity.</li><li>Fill out Hannah&rsquo;s first marriage, children.</li><li>more on Ellen Gould.</li><li>Hallockville, Factoryville</li><li>More legal research on deeds for Mills&rsquo; home and store, estates, etc.</li><li>General information about Brooktondale during Emily&rsquo;s life.</li></ul><p>I have already collected much of this information, its just a matter of getting it organized here.</p><h2 id=unanswered-questions-and-areas-of-further-research>Unanswered Questions and Areas of Further Research</h2><ul>
<li>More precise birthdates and birthplaces for Jonas, Horace, Emily, Hannah.

Pine, co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, related to Edward&rsquo;s wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine?</li><li>Photos of anyone in the Mills family, the stores, the homes, but in particular, a photo of Emily and her store in Brookton, M. E. Mills.</li><li>See if there are radio schedules from April 1923 to see if we can deduce the radio concert that Emily and Ellen listened to at the Mulks'.</li><li>Train schedules, routes from Brookton to Corfu, corresponding to family burials.</li><li>More information is needed about Emily&rsquo;s involvement in the Ladie&rsquo;s Aid Society and Red Cross. The Ladie&rsquo;s Aid ceased activity in the past decade but while active, kept a record of their activities that is separate from the main church books. I am making arrangements to view these records and expect to find significant clues about the activities of Emily and Jessie Brewer among other contemporaries. In particular, its possible mention of Emily&rsquo;s funeral arrangements would help explain the erroneous 1861 birthdate. There may also be more clues about Reverend Eastman in those notes.</li><li>Donna E. believes that the Ithaca office of the Red Cross has scrapbooks of their own history: I have contacted them, and I am awaiting a response.</li><li>Research the apparent purchase for subsequent rental: a barn 23 Sep 1907.</li><li>Where did Emily go around 20 Mar 1917? (roughly a month after Hannah&rsquo;s death.) Ellen Gould is said to be keeping house, suggesting that Emily was out of town for a period of time.</li><li>Why is Hannah interred at Pleasant Grove Cemetery? (Other family there?)</li><li>Did Edward ever work at &ldquo;(Samuel) Scudder&rsquo;s general country store&rdquo; on Long Island?</li><li>The circumstances of Horace&rsquo;s death: Was it related to alcohol, and the reason for Emily&rsquo;s passion for temperance? Presumably this will never be knowable, but perhaps there will be clues in the Good Templars notebooks.</li><li>Presumably Horace&rsquo;s death is at least part of the reason why the family moved <em>away from</em> Corfu?</li><li>But why did they move <em>to</em> Mott&rsquo;s Corners? Perhaps relevant: there are a number of Hallocks living throughout Tompkins County, including Brooktondale prior to, and contemporary, with the Mills. I don&rsquo;t know if these are distant relations or not. Mott&rsquo;s Corners appeared to be a politically progressive place even then, which would perhaps appeal to Emily who was just finishing school (and temperance along with suffrage and abolition were among the major progressive issues of the day), in combination with the financial opportunities of a mill town near Ithaca? Is Edward Lounsbery the key? The Mills live in a home he initially owned, operated the store in another building he owned, evidence suggests they had other business arrangements?</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66471939/william-b-hallock>William B.
