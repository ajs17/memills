				<h2 id="physical-artifacts-remaining">Physical Artifacts Remaining</h2>
<p>The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this.</p>
<p>There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter House next door (the Shurter House sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton). Any photos taken from the parking lot of Mulk&rsquo;s store looking southwest should be examined closely for the Mill&rsquo;s store in the background across the street.</p>
<p>In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection.</p>
<p>Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866. Neither of those structures survive today.</p>
<p>We actually have copious amounts of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting spanning many decades:</p>
<ul>
<li>A notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880&rsquo;s. A number of entries are written in Emily&rsquo;s hand while she was secretary. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization written by her. These items are kept in the Tompkins County History Center archives.</li>
<li>Approximately a dozen volumes of sales journals of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920&rsquo;s were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The journals are in excellent condition, and we can match Emily&rsquo;s handwriting to the known examples from the Good Templars notes. &ldquo;No. 41&rdquo; is the most important as it shows the time and some details of Edward&rsquo;s death.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tompkins County History Center archives also has at least two examples of postmarks that bear Edward&rsquo;s name: &ldquo;E. H. Mills, P. M.&rdquo;. Interestingly, these are envelopes with attached correspondence showing it was Good Templars business and associated with Emily. I have also purchased a few examples of other postmarked envelopes sold online by stamp collectors.</p>
<p><em>A Note on Emily Mills</em>, mentions &ldquo;a little leatherette booklet&rdquo; M. E. Mills printed on it, and Molly&rsquo;s research notes indicate that this item was donated to the Caroline History Room in March 2002, but as of an inquiry in 2021, it could not be located.</p>
<p>A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois (E. D. Shurter) and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.</p>
<p>The Good Templars items at the Tompkins County History Center appear to be most closely associated with Emily&rsquo;s activities, so it seems logical that the origin narrative of the Good Templars items, and possibly a number of others at the Center, such as the 1917 W. C. T. U. directory, can be traced back to Emily: these were her possessions, kept for many decades, that came into Jessie Brewer&rsquo;s possession when she purchased Emily&rsquo;s property at auction in 1938. As Jessie went through Emily&rsquo;s things, she took special care to save these remembrances of her old friends, and Emily in particular, and the very personal keepsake of her handwriting. If I am correct, it suggests a deep affection between these two, who were neighbors for many decades and who shared so much. Upon her death, Jessie Brewer made a significant donation to the library in Dryden which seems worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>If you review the boxes of W. C. T. U. directories, you will see that one book in particular is oddly out of place: a 1917 directory that is unique, as most of the others are from the 1930&rsquo;s and several decades after. This is intriguing for a few reasons: 1917 is the year Hannah died, and as she was a very highly regarded member, there is some chance of a connection there, although that may be a stretch. But also consider that the 1917 book is the only one that I found (after an admittedly modest review of the books from Emily&rsquo;s lifetime, given the access and time constraints) that explicitly documents Emily as a member. The coincidence seems potentially significant.</p>
<h2 id="information-yet-to-be-incorporated">Information Yet To Be Incorporated</h2>
<p>Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:</p>
<ul>
<li>finish Temperance activity.</li>
<li>Fill out Hannah&rsquo;s first marriage, children.</li>
<li>more on Ellen Gould.</li>
<li>Hallockville, Factoryville</li>
<li>More legal research on deeds for Mills' home and store, estates, etc.</li>
<li>General information about Brooktondale during Emily&rsquo;s life.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have already collected much of this information, its just a matter of getting it organized here.</p>
<h2 id="unanswered-questions-and-areas-of-further-research">Unanswered Questions and Areas of Further Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>More precise birthdates and birthplaces for Jonas, Horace, Emily, Hannah.</li>
<li>What is the source of &ldquo;1961&rdquo; as birth year on Emily&rsquo;s gravestone?</li>
<li>Jonas' and Horace&rsquo;s full middle names.</li>
<li>Corroborate Horace&rsquo;s date of death, as Evergreen Hill Cemetery directory listing is the only source of a date and given the mistakes in Edward&rsquo;s listing, I can&rsquo;t be completely confident in it.</li>
<li>Who were the sources for the gossip columns in those years?</li>
<li>Did Emily write Hannah&rsquo;s obituary?</li>
<li>Is Charles M. Pine, co-owner of E. H. Mills &amp; Co. in Corfu, related to Edward&rsquo;s wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine?</li>
<li>Photo of anyone in Mills family, the stores, the homes, but in particular, a photo of Emily and her store in Brookton, M. E. Mills.</li>
<li>Charles Personius Mills?</li>
<li>See if there are radio schedules from April 1923 to see if we can deduce the radio concert that Emily and Ellen listened to at the Mulks'.</li>
<li>Train schedules, routes from Brookton to Corfu, corresponding to family burials.</li>
<li>More information is needed about Emily&rsquo;s involvement in the Ladies Aid Society and Red Cross.</li>
<li>Donna E. believes that the Ithaca office of the Red Cross has scrapbooks of their own history: I have contacted them and awaiting a response.</li>
<li>Research the apparent purchase for subsequent rental: a barn 23 Sep 1907.</li>
<li>Where did Emily go around 20 Mar 1917? (roughly a month after Hannah&rsquo;s death.) Ellen Gould is said to be keeping house, suggesting that Emily was out of town for a period of time.</li>
<li>Why is Hannah interred at Pleasant Grove Cemetery? (Other family there?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Horace&rsquo;s Death:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presumably why the family moved <em>away from</em> Corfu?</li>
<li>But why <em>to</em> Mott&rsquo;s Corners? (Perhaps relevant: there are a number of Hallocks living throughout Tompkins County, including Brooktondale prior to, and contemporary, with the Mills. I don&rsquo;t know if these are distant relations or not.)</li>
<li>The nature of Horace&rsquo;s death, and was alcohol a significant factor? Presumably this will never be knowable, but perhaps there will be clues in the Good Templars notebooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Church Records and Baptism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review records for other mentions of Emily, including her being an officer in the church.</li>
<li>Entries mentioning Emily or Edward before they officially joined?</li>
<li>Any information on Emily&rsquo;s baptism from Park Church, any diaries of Reverend Ford Eastman? (Contacted.)</li>
<li>Is there significance to the date? Easter was on 3/31 in 1907. 4/7 did fall on a Sunday</li>
<li>Catalog all information about Reverend Annis Ford Eastman, including her return trips, see if Emily&rsquo;s baptism was the Rev&rsquo;s last visit to Brookton.</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have started a complete photo inventory of the notebooks of George Jansen and plan to organize and transcribe these in the future. There are a number of entries that mention work that George does on behalf of Emily, planting her garden, painting her store, chopping wood, etc. As I am able, I will add those records to this account.</li>
<li>research deeds on Mill&rsquo;s home and Mill&rsquo;s store prior to 1900. When did the Mills start living there? Survey maps that show mill race? Who owned the Mills store real estate?</li>
<li>Photo inventory and digitally transcribe the complete notebook of Good Templars meeting minutes. Try to find a link between Horace&rsquo;s death and Emily&rsquo;s temperance activities, and a possible clue to Mott&rsquo;s Corners move. (Begun.)</li>
<li>Research Emily&rsquo;s baptism, possibly contacting descendants of Annis Ford Eastman for information on that event. Check church records again: was this the Reverend&rsquo;s very last visit to Brookton? Letters exist at Univ of Ill library between the Reverend and her family.</li>
<li>The dimensions and timing of the (&ldquo;approximately&rdquo;) 1915 photo of Brooktondale Road that shows the front of M. E. Mills and the Mill&rsquo;s home could have been taken by Alice Shurter?</li>
<li>I believe there is ample contextual evidence to suggest that Emily was a member of the Ladies Aid Society and also involved in some capacity with the Red Cross, although I don&rsquo;t believe I have direct evidence of these.</li>
</ul>
