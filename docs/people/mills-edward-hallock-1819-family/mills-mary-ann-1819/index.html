<h2 id="churches-in-corfu">Churches in Corfu</h2>
<p>We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:</p>

<blockquote>
The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

<p>The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>
<p>The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, &ldquo;religion had not gone west of the Genesee River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.</p>
  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4
<p>The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long&rsquo;s Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the &ldquo;First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke&rdquo; drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.</p>
<p>There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke&rdquo; was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the &ldquo;Corfu United Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; The Congregationalist&rsquo;s never did reform.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 
<p>I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn&rsquo;t exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.</p>
