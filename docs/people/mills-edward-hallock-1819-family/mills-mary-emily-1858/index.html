<p>Emily was likely named for one of her ancestors, although, as the name Mary is quite common within both the Mills and Hallock families, there are several candidates for whom. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she would typically use &ldquo;M. Emily Mills&rdquo;, particularly in later years.</p>
<p>There are only two primary sources that assert Emily&rsquo;s date of birth: her gravestone that states the year was 1861—which has since been the accepted date for obvious reasons—and an entry in the 1900 US census where Emily indicates it was &ldquo;Dec 1858&rdquo;. The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily&rsquo;s lifetieme, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily&rsquo;s self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the &ldquo;Computed birthyear&rdquo; column above. Given that these were self-reported by Emily, and we don&rsquo;t know the origin of the (I might add, less specific) 1861 date (Emily may have died before making funeral arrangements), December 1858 seems the more accurate date and will be used going forward, implying the grave stone is in error.</p>

<p>Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily&rsquo;s exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. I am in contact with Calvary Presbyterian Church in Staten Island, which seems like the most likely candidate for the church that Mary Ann may have belonged to at the time, to see if they have birth records for her children.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly when the family moved to Corfu; census records indicate they were in Staten Island as late as 1859 and then E. H. Mills &amp; Co. appears on 1866 maps of Corfu, alhtough perhaps the fact that E. H. Mills &amp; Co. is in several places referred to generically as &ldquo;Cash Store&rdquo; indicates it was relatively new at that time.</p>
<p>Emily would return in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But it would seem that she also returned to visit her school friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.</p>

The entry above appeared in the "Corfu Mentions." column for "Corfu, June 20" the date is presumably a mis-print.

<p>The only thing we really know about Emily&rsquo;s earliest years in Mott&rsquo;s Corners/Brookton is that she was active in the local &ldquo;lodge&rdquo; of the Independent Order of Good Templars, a local temperance organization.</p>

<li>&ldquo;Miss Esther Vorhis&rdquo; is a reference to Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe (1893-1964) who descendents have confirmed went by Esther.  See also a Jan 28, 1960 article on p3 of The Ithaca Journal that references a &ldquo;Mrs. Esther Vorhis Pancoe of Brooktondale.&rdquo; Esther was <a href="#the-baptism-of-emily-mills">baptized with Emily</a>, where she is listed as &ldquo;C.

<ul>
<li>Although the age given here does not match any proposed birth year for Emily, it is still closer to 1858, being off by as little as 13 months from that year, and in fact errs on the side of being older still, further calling 1861 into question.</li>

<p>This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily&rsquo;s only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>IN TRIBUTE TO EMILY MILLS</strong></p>
<p>To the Editor of The Journal:</p>
<p>The recent death of Miss Emily Mills, a long-time resident of Brooktondale, deserves more than passing notice. For some thirty years she conducted at this place the general store in which she formerly served as helper to her father.</p>
<p>Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly, she aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending credit for groceries to many needy individuals. Paraphrasing the remarks of Robert G. Ingersoll at his brother&rsquo;s funeral: If everyone to whom Miss Mills extended a helpful hand were to place a floral emblem upon her grave, she would sleep today amidst a wilderness of flowers.</p>
<p>A devoted member of the Congregational Church at this place, teacher in the Sunday School, she went about her daily round of duties with a Christian fortitude and faithfulnes that were greatly appreciated and will be long remembered by her host of friends who join in this tribute to the memory of one who, even as her great Exemplar, went about doing good.</p>
<p>E. D. Shurter,
Brooktondale</p>

<p>The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, we can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily&rsquo;s first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn&rsquo;t know some of the most important aspects of Emily&rsquo;s life, most notably, her charity, One senses that the professor understood he was writing what would be the definitive statement of her life for the ages, and indeed, in several histories where Emily is mentioned, her only description consists of the text of this tribute, in its entirety, without further comment.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-emily-mills-by-molly-adams">A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams</h3>
<p>Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.</p>
<p>Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this &ldquo;Note&rdquo; with some interest initially, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.</p>

<blockquote><h4 id="a-note-on-emily-mills">A Note on Emily Mills</h4>
<p>Before David VanDeMark&rsquo;s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing
machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet
labeled on the outside &ldquo;M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE
AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.&rdquo; On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to
July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a
complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much
appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”</p>
<p>Mary Emily Mills, known as Emily, was born in 1861 and died in 1937. In the
1892 Census she is listed as a &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; in her father&rsquo;s store. Emily&rsquo;s father was Edward
H. Mills, who died January 1, 1908, leaving &ldquo;stock and accounts of a going, general
merchandise business in the village of Brookton&rdquo; and a parcel known as “the Mills
Store lot,” valued at $500. Edward Mills died without a will, and Emily was appointed
executor of the estate, being more competent for such business than her elderly
mother Hannah, The estate was settled in August, 1909, so the little sewing booklet
represents Emily Mills’ first attempt at advertising after she took over the store.</p>
<p>The Mills Store was located in the building which Brooktondale residents know
today as the &ldquo;old postoffice,&rdquo; across the street from the TNT. Mr. Mills had operated a
store for 29 years (and was postmaster during the Cleveland administration), but we
don’t know if it was always in this location. The family lived across the street in a
house built on &ldquo;part of the Grist Mill Lot&rdquo; [the Grist Mill foundation supports the
current Dalebrook Apartments]. In 1891 the house was owned by Esther Vorhis, but
twas occupied by E. H. Mills &ldquo;as tenant.&rdquo; The house lot was measured starting at &ldquo;the
Center of the bridge crossing the Mill race.&rdquo; The property was sold to Mr. Mills by
Edward and Amanda Lounsbery in 1903.</p>
<p>Emily Mills died in 1937, having kept the store with its &ldquo;kerosene, kerosene
lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins
and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases&rdquo; (and groceries) all that time. Her
obituary notes that she &ldquo;aided materially the Caroline welfare director by extending
credit for groceries to many needy individuals.&rdquo; Jessie Brewer, who had grown up in
the house next door as Jessie Shurter, bought the store and Emily&rsquo;s house and
continued the business, adding a lending library in the back room. In 1961, Charles
Vorhis bought the store and moved the post office across the street from the current
TNT Market, where it had occupied the side addition.</p>

<p>POST OFFICE #3</p>
<p>In 1961, Postmaster Charles Vorhis bought Jessie Brewer&rsquo;s store and moved the post office [Location #3] across the street [from location #2, at Tucker&rsquo;s Store]. This store had been Mr. Mills' dry goods store and was carried on for thirty years after his death by his daughter Emily Mills, who carried kerosene, kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins and sewing notions, sheets and pillowcases (and some groceries?). [Driveby, ie Conant] Emily Mills died in 1937. Jessie Brewer, who grew up in the house next door as Jessie Shurter, kept a dry goods store here after Miss Mills died and had a lending library in the back of the store. [1944 Caroline phone directory: &ldquo;Dry Goods, Notions &amp; Blankets&rdquo; CH p. 101] The Shurter House, which sat between the post office and the bridge, was moved to 447 Brooktondale Road in 1964 when the road through Brooktondale was improved.</p>

<blockquote><p>Emily Mills' store was in the building where the Post Office is today. I remember it as a dark place with long rows of counters on each side and tables and glass-topped counters in the middle. Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon&rsquo;s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.</p>
<p>She had yard goods, bias tape, combs, lace hankerchiefs, and many things you could buy for presents for ten cents and up. There were racks of thread, needles, pins and all the things we needed for our 4-H projects.</p>
<p>She had groceries, and took butter and eggs in trade. Butter was weighed on her scales. The scales had a large scoop at one end, and little weights at the other. I don&rsquo;t remember her selling meat, but she probably did. Many people had kerosene lights then, and she sold it by the gallon. You took your container, and she filled it, usually with a potato on the end so it wouldn&rsquo;t spill. Marilyn and I would go do the shopping for Aunt Mina, with a cart in the Summer and a sled in the Winter to carry them home with.</p>
<p>Miss Mills also taught Sunday School at the Congregational Church and played the piano. It must have been a class for older people, as I never had her for a teacher.</p>
<p>I remember her as very kind, and I was shocked to learn someone had stolen things from her while she was busy with another customer.</p>
<p>She lived across the street from Dr. Lockwood, in a little house that sat back near the hill. Her father had the store before her. Apparently she never married. She had a woman who lived in and kept house for [her] and cooked the meals, and would stay in the store while she ate lunch and supper. I can&rsquo;t remember her name, but she looked a great deal like Miss Mills.</p>
<p>After Miss Mills died, Jessie (Shurter) Brewer had a notions store here. No groceries, just sewing supplies, hosiery and a few dresses, etc. She also had a lending library in the back, where I found many western and mystery stories to read. She ran the store for some time, and I always enjoyed shopping there and talking to her. She had a bell on the door, that rang next door so she could come over when she had customers.</p>
<p>Upstairs the building had a long hall, with a stage at one end. There were outside stairs leading to the second floor, but I had not noticed much about it, until a traveling show had a performance here. Many buildings in the village had such &ldquo;halls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today the Postoffice is in this building and the upstairs is an apartment.</p>

<blockquote>Brooktondale looked much like this, with a few more trees, when I was small. (This photo was taken about 1915). The buliding at the far left was Mills' store when I was in grade school. Dr. Lockwood house, which he had remodeled some was next door. Miss Mills lived in the house at the right. She also taught Sunday School and played the organ or piano in the Congregational Church. The trestle is in the middle background. Beyond Dr. Lockwood house was Charles and Annie Mulks, and then a meat market, at other times a barbershop.</blockquote>
