According to Wikipedia: &ldquo;Mary Torrans Lathrap née, Torrans; (pen name, Lena; April 25, 1838 - January 3, 1895), known as &ldquo;The Daniel Webster of Prohibition&rdquo;, was a 19th-century American poet, preacher, suffragist, and temperance reformer. For 20 years, she was identified with the progressive women of Michigan who had temperance, purity, and prohibition as their watchwords, and the white ribbon as their badge. A licensed preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church (1871), she served as president of Michigan&rsquo;s Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union (1882), co-founded the state&rsquo;s suffrage organization (1870), and worked on the amendment campaign (1874). Lathrap died in 1895.&rdquo; Note the parallels to Annis Ford Eastman. This poem has been used often in obituaries since it was penned, either in part or in its entirety, and it was obviously a fitting tribute to Hannah&rsquo;s life.</li><li><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus>Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus</a> (19 Nov 1843 to 12 Oct 1925).

<pre>
Beautiful toiler, thy work all done,
Beautiful soul into glory gone,
Beautiful life with its crown now won,
    God giveth thee rest.
Rest from all sorrows, and watching, and fears,
Rest from all possible sighing and tears,
Rest through God's endless, wonderful years —
    At home with the blest.
<br>
Beautiful spirit, free from all stain,
Ours the heartache, the sorrow and pain,
Thine is the glory and infinite gain —
    Thy slumber is sweet.
Peace on the brow and the eyelids so calm,
Peace in the heart, ‘neath the white folded palm,
Peace dropping down like a wondrous balm
    From the head to the feet.
<br>
“It was so sudden,” our white lips said,
“How we shall miss her, the beautiful dead,
Who take the place of the precious one fled;
    But Got knoweth best.
We know He watches the sparrows that fall,
Hears the sad cry of the grieved hearts that call,
Friends, husband, children, He loveth them all —
    We can trust for the rest.”

<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/166934176/william-vanderveere>William P. Vandermeere</a> (04 Sep 1831 to 27 May 1882).</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>After Thomas&rsquo;s death, Hannah&rsquo;s mother lived with the Vandermeere&rsquo;s (perhaps sometimes spelled Vandermere) in Ithaca. William Vandermeere was a local farmer, and also an English immigrant. Beyond that, I do not know the exact relationship between the Thatchers and Vandermeeres.</p>
<p>As with Emily, the birth year on Hannah&rsquo;s grave is incorrect based on two independent sources: the 1900 United States Federal census in which Hannah self reports being born &ldquo;May 1824&rdquo; in England:</p>

<p>The exact date is reported in The Ithaca Journal, 23 May 1916, p9: &ldquo;Mrs. Hannah Mills spent her ninety-second birthday Sunday, May 21.&rdquo; Yet her stone lists the dates as 1825 to 1917.</p>
<p>As I write this in Spring 2022, the Thatcher stone is badly weathered and difficult to read, Hannah&rsquo;s face in particular. The footstones are in even worse condition. The plot is in the front of the cemetery, the middle section, a few rows back from the road. The Thatcher name faces the back of the cemetery, and Hannah&rsquo;s side faces toward Community Corners in Cayuga Heights.</p>

<p>Hannah&rsquo;s siblings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023538/david-thatcher>David Thatcher</a> (15 Jun 1816 to 1893). Married: <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023539/agnes-thatcher>Agnes (Tannahill) Thatcher</a> (1828 to 1896). Their children:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67026254/nellie-g-tompkins>Nellie G. (Thatcher) Tompkins</a> (1859 to 30 May 1935), wife of <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67026252/monroe-j-tompkins>Monroe J. Tompkins</a> (1856 to 1919).</p>
<ul>
<li>Monroe Earl Tompkins (24 Jan 1897 to 07 Jun 1963), Nellie and Monroe&rsquo;s son. Typically referred to as &ldquo;Earl Tompkins&rdquo; there are also records for him that indicate &ldquo;Earl M. Tompkins&rdquo;. Other children of Nellie and Monroe are Olin and Myrtle (Tompkins) Talbett.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/122023540/edward-c-thatcher>Edward C. Thatcher</a> (1863 to 04 Jun 1937), Hannah&rsquo;s nephew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690565/minnie-a-smith>Minnie A. (Thatcher) Smith</a> (1867 to 23 Jun 1936), married to <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86690515/william-smith>Dr. William A. Smith</a> (01 Feb 186? to 31 Mar 1934), former Tompkins County Coroner. Minnie&rsquo;s obituary notes: &ldquo;she is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Agnes Shulman of Ithaca and Mrs. Alleine Estabrook of Newfield&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the Thatchers and the Tompkins are associated with the towns of Newfield and Catharine, with Edward living in Cayutaville, and a few descendants living in Ithaca.</p>
<p>Currently unknown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188088574/myron-n-tompkins>Myron N. Tompkins</a> (1859 to 21 Mar 1911) former Dean of the Tompkins county bar. I do not currently know the relationship between Myron and the other Tompkins&rsquo;, if any, but he is the person Hannah named as her executor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edgar Thatcher. I initially thought this was a mistaken reference to Edward Thatcher, and that is still a possibility, but I have seen this name referenced in a few places, so perhaps not. I have been unable to identify this person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hannah&rsquo;s immigration information is based on naturalization documents of her brother David Thatcher from 1839, that are on still on file with the Tompkins County Clerk&rsquo;s Office. I conclude this document identifies Hannah Mills&rsquo; brother based on the document matching several known data points: first and last name, town of residence, age, country of origin, and the voyage happened within the expected timeframe. As a result, I am also using this document as the source for David&rsquo;s exact birthdate, as prior to seeing this, I only knew the year.</p>

<blockquote>
Dr. W. A. Smith's full name was Dr. William Addison Smith and he lived up South St., now called Shaffer Rd. on the right I think a short distance behind the Tioga State Bank.  I know his full name as I remember the old folks calling him William Addison Smith.  He and his wife, Minnie A. are buried over in the Laurel Hill Cemetery east of Odessa in the Town of Catharine.  His stone reads William A. Smith, M. D., blank - 1934.  His wife Minnie A. reads, blank - 1936 and Anna E. Smith 1877 - 1960. Anna's grave marker is right next to the grave marker for Dr. Smith and his wife Minnie.
