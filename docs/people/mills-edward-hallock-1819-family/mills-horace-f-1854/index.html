<p>Horace is the single biggest mystery in the family, all the more so because his death seems to be a pivotal event in the family&rsquo;s history:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/evergreen-hill-cemetery-51_hudcd2aa7af59f69ac71fbaef3f36f7b09_109283_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=99 alt><blockquote><p>MILLS, Edward H. d. 1/6/1908 2:51 b.1819, d. at Ithaca NY, a. 89 yr.</p><p>MILLS, Horace F. d. 10/27/1876 2:51 suicide by gunshot</p><p>MILLS, Jonas E. d. 1885 2:51</p><p>MILLS, Mary Ann d. 1895 2:51 b.1819, w. of Edward H. MILLS</p></blockquote><figcaption>— <cite>Evergreen Hills Cemetery, Corfu, directory listing, cropped image, page 51 is indicated in original, received by email May 21, 2021, personal correspondence with Diana Reding, Library Director at Corfu Public Library</cite>.<a class=origversion href=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/evergreen-hill-cemetery-51.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption><aside><p>Notes:</p><ul>
<li>Obviously, Edward&rsquo;s date of death is incorrect. The only connection with Jan 6 is the publication of his obituaries.</li><li>Given the innaccuracy with Edward&rsquo;s date of death, Horace&rsquo;s should be viewed with skepticism. as well. Presently, this is the only documentation of his death, so until evidence to the contrary is discovered, this will be assumed to be his death date.</li></ul></aside></figure><p>Presumably, the fact that the family moved away from Corfu a few years after his death is more than coincidental, but that is speculation. However, this could also explain why Emily was so active in the <a href=https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/temperance/>temperance movement</a>, if alcohol was a factor in Horace&rsquo;s death.</p><p>It is unlikely that the exact details of Horace&rsquo;s death would have ever been recorded, but I continue to search for clues:</p><ul>
<li>I have contacted the Batavia Daily News for help as they may have old editions that have not yet been digitized and made publicly available, and therefore, currently outside my ability to pursue in any other way. Although there may not be an account of his death, he may be featured in other reporting that may shed light on his life circumstances. (Then again, it appears that suicides were regularly reported on in that time.)</li><li>I have taken an initial photographic inventory of every page of the Good Templars meeting minutes, and I intend to read these more closely for clues.</li></ul><p>And a very big mystery relevant to the Caroline audience in particular, is why they chose Mott&rsquo;s Corners as their next destination? At this point, I have only a few vague theories to explore.</p><ul>
<li>If the Caroline area was a particularly active area for Temperance, that could have been a draw. But, it is unclear if anyone in Emily&rsquo;s family were involved in temperance.</li><li>They knew someone who lived Mott&rsquo;s Corners.</li><li>Perhaps Edward sold products from the mills and factories of Mott&rsquo;s Corners in his store and knew of it that way?</li><li>As Edward Mills appeared to have multiple business relationships with Edward Lounsbery, perhaps that offers at least a partial explanation.</li></ul><p>Horace is <a href=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75958913/horace-f-mills>interred</a> at Evergreen Hill Cemetery, 112 Alleghany Rd, Corfu, NY 14036.</p><h3 id=notes-for-future-researchers>Notes for Future Researchers</h3><p>As already discussed above in relation to the Evergreen Hill Cemetery records and Horaces date of death, the vital details of Horace&rsquo;s life all come from single sources of information. As they are uncorroborated, they should be treated with skepticism until verified. However, it is likely that many of these details will never be able to be verified, so for now, I am treating what data I do have as true.</p><p>There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800&rsquo;s, who was of some prominence, but who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos of this Horace Mills can be found online.</p><p>Yet another Horace F. Mills lived in Wawayanda, NY mentioned in Port Jervis newspapers in the 1870&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s. He was married to M. J. Mills and had a daughter Bertha who died at four months old.</p><p>And most frustrating of all is an unrelated Horace Mills listed in the 1850 United Stated Federal Census as a one year old living in Darien, which is very close to Corfu:</p><figure class=image style=max-width:800px><img src=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/census/census-1850-us_hua05d3089a6521a1d8baec05daab54a3b_1185237_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg width=800 height=1034 alt><figcaption>— <cite>1850, United States Federal Census, ancestry.com</cite>.<a class=origversion href=/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/assets/images/census/census-1850-us.jpg>View largest available size.</a></figcaption></figure><p>If this Horace was still living in the area at the same time as Edward&rsquo;s son, and especially being of similar age, extra care should be taken to correctly identify any reporting on &ldquo;Horace Mills&rdquo; at the time in the local papers. Given Edward&rsquo;s stature in the community, it seems likely that in any reporting his son would be identified in relation to him, perhaps something such as &ldquo;Horace Mills, son of a local merchant&mldr;.&rdquo;</p></div></article></main><aside>
