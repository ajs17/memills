The most important detail is obviously the date of birth: “May” is clear, but the rest is open to interpretation.

The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington. The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square. It is rumored that the name is in honor of Benjamin Franklin.&rdquo;</li><li>Note that this references prior publication of this notice in the Hempstead Sentinel, so there is some chance of finding more legible text.
