<p>All of the Mills children would be born in Staten Island and the family would live there until at least the Summer of 1860, according to census data. By that point, Edward was working as a clerk in the grocery store of Bartlett Brown and living in his home adjoining the store.</p>
<p>By 1863, the family would be in Corfu and Edward would become co-owner of <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/corfu-eh-mills-co/"><strong>E. H. Mills &amp; Co.</strong></a> &ldquo;cash store&rdquo; where his son Horace would clerk for him as Edward had for Bartlett.</p>

<p><a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/mills-horace-f-1854/">Horace</a> would commit suicide in Corfu in Oct 1876, and in Mar 1879, the family would once again move, this time to Motts Corners. There, Edward would restart his grocery and dry goods business on his own as <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/features/me-mills/"><strong>E. H. Mills</strong></a>. Both <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/mills-jonas-e-1852/">Jonas</a> and <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/mills-mary-emily-1858/">Emily</a> would clerk for their father. Jonas would die suddenly after a brief illness in Oct 1885.</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s obituary mentions that he was &ldquo;postmaster during the Cleveland administration&rdquo; which I can confirm refers to the first Cleveland administration from 1885 to 1889. (To date, Cleveland is the only president to have two non-consecutive terms.) A partial list of Brooktondale postmasters from usps.gov, beginning with the very first, up to the 1970&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>Mary Ann would pass on the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary. A year and two days later, Edward would marry <a href="https://memills.com/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819-family/mills-hannah-1824/">Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman (1824-1917)</a>. Whether perhaps by superstition or some practical matter, the date chosen seems less likely to be a coincidence due to the fact that Edward joined the church on the third to last Sunday before the marriage ceremony.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>DEATH OF MRS. E. H. MILLS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event occurred in Brookton, Tompkins County—Interrment at Corfu.</strong></p>
<p>Corfu, Dec 31.—The remains of Mrs. E. H. Mills of Brookton, Tompkins county, arrived here on the 4:26 p. m. train yesterday and were interred in Evergreen Hill Cemetery. The deceased was the wife of Edward H. Mills who was for many years a prominent merchant in this village who removed to Tompkins county sixteen years ago, re-engaging in mercantile pursuits, and where he has since resided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mills was in usual health a week ago yesterday morning, but before night complained of a soreness in one of her fingers. Her daughter examined it and found what appeared to be a small splinter of wood, which she removed and which appeared to relieve her, but blood poisoning ensued and she continued to grow worse until Saturday, when death relieved her of her suffering. Her remains were accompanied by her husband and an only daughter, Emily Mills, who alone survive her and who possess the heartfelt sympathy of many friends in this vicinity who remember her as a kind friend and a devoted Christian whose sublime faith made her life beautiful and to the last degree exemplary.</p>
<p>Mr. Mills and daughter spent last night with Mr. and Mrs. W. W. McGregor and returned home this morning.</p>

<p>VERDICT FOR THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.</p>
<p>&hellip;
The next case tried was that of Tompkins County vs. E. H. Mills. Edward H. Burdick for plaintiff, C. R. Wolcott for defendant. This was a case similar to the Beardsley case, an agent of the State Board of Pharmacy, purchasing poisonous drugs at the store of Mr. Mills in Brookton. In this case the jury took a different view of the matter and brought in a verdict of $50 in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

<blockquote><p>1908 Deaths Continued</p>
<p>Edward Hallioch[sic] Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.</p>
<p>In Mar. 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.</p>
<p>He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.</p>
<p>In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.</p>

<li>Variations of Edward&rsquo;s middle name exist, such as &ldquo;Hallioch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloch&rdquo; however these seem to be errors as Edward&rsquo;s middle name appears to be taken from his mother&rsquo;s maiden name: &ldquo;Hallock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rev. Woodworth&rdquo; refers to Reverend Allen Beach Woodworth (1837-1910), whose obituary in the Ithaca Daily News (12 Sep 1910, p3) states was the long-time pastor of the Brookton Baptist Church. This was a transition period between pastors for the Congregational Church, and in both the Ithaca Daily News and the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church, Reverend Woodworth is noted as performing Sunday services at the Congregational Church as well as officiating funerals for Congregation members during this time, presumably helping out in his retirement. Church records are vague on the point, but its quite likely he helped out irregularly over many months as the Congregational Church needed his services. In the Mills store sales journals, Emily notes paying Reverend Woodworth $3.00 for attending Edward&rsquo;s funeral.</li>

<p>There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills &amp; Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880&rsquo;s that was a &ldquo;knitting factory&rdquo; and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. This appears to be a completely different family based on the following city directories that list family members who are unaccounted for in the Mills Genealogy and are not documented in anything else we know about the Mills.</p>
