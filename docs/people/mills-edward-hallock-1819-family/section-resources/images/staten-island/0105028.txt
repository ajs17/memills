Pub Note	Unrecorded 2.5 edition. This is not in any records we can find; all records show 1839 and 1841 edition (2nd and 3rd). There are following differences between this and the 1841 edition: date on title page, dates of 1839 on several of the maps - particularly the lower counties, the division of Genessee County into Genessee and Wyoming (in 1841 edition), the addition of a page of statistics from the 1840 census (in 1841 edition), no color on title page, and quite different coloring in the two editions. We cannot find any changes in the maps themselves. Maps in full hand painted color. Relief shown by hachures.
