## Notes for Future Researchers

There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. This appears to be a completely different family based on the following city directories that list family members who are unaccounted for in the Mills Genealogy and are not documented in anything else we know about the Mills.

The members of this family can just barely be made out in the 1875 New York State Census in Fulton County:

 Edward Hallock's family are accounted for in the same census in Genesee County:
