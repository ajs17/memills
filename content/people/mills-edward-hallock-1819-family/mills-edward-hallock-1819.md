Edward Hallock Mills, born 25 Mar 1819, Smithtown, NY, died 01 Jan 1908, Brookton, NY. Patriarch of the Mills family. Co-owner, general stores [**E. H. Mills & Co.**]({{% ref "features/corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) in Cofu NY and owner [**E. H. Mills**]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}) in Motts Corners/Brookton NY.

From his birthplace of Smithtown NY, Edward would be living in [Factoryville (West New Brighton) Staten Island]({{% ref "features/staten-island" %}}) by the time he married his first wife [Mary Ann Pine (1819-1895)]({{% ref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) in 1851.

All of the Mills children would be born in Staten Island and the family would live there until at least the Summer of 1860, according to census data. By that point, Edward was working as a clerk in the grocery store of Bartlett Brown and living in his home adjoining the store. 

By 1863, the family would be in Corfu and Edward would become co-owner of [**E. H. Mills & Co.**]({{% ref "features/corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) "cash store" where his son Horace would clerk for him as Edward had for Bartlett.

[Horace]({{% ref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) would commit suicide in Corfu in Oct 1876, and in Mar 1879, the family would once again move, this time to Motts Corners. There, Edward would restart his grocery and dry goods business on his own as [**E. H. Mills**]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}). Both [Jonas]({{% ref "mills-jonas-e-1852" %}}) and [Emily]({{% ref "mills-mary-emily-1858" %}}) would clerk for their father. Jonas would die suddenly after a brief illness in Oct 1885.

Edward's obituary mentions that he was "postmaster during the Cleveland administration" which I can confirm refers to the first Cleveland administration from 1885 to 1889. (To date, Cleveland is the only president to have two non-consecutive terms.) A partial list of Brooktondale postmasters from usps.gov, beginning with the very first, up to the 1970's:

The following are examples of Edward's postmark during that time:

Mary Ann would pass on the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary. A year and two days later, Edward would marry [Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman (1824-1917)]({{% ref "mills-hannah-1824" %}}). Whether perhaps by superstition or some practical matter, the date chosen seems less likely to be a coincidence due to the fact that Edward joined the church on the third to last Sunday before the marriage ceremony.

Edward and Hannah joined the church just weeks before their wedding:

Emily officially joined the church rolls in the months immediately following Edward's illness. Emily was the first to note Edward's death in the sales journal of E. H. Mills general store, on an otherwise normal day of the store's operation:

## Notes for Future Researchers

There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. This appears to be a completely different family based on the following city directories that list family members who are unaccounted for in the Mills Genealogy and are not documented in anything else we know about the Mills. 

{{% mefig "1882-gloversville-directory-p85" "700" /%}}
{{% mefig "1886-gloversville-directory-p77" "700" /%}}

The members of this family can just barely be made out in the 1875 New York State Census in Fulton County:

{{% mefig "census/census-1875b-nys" "400" /%}}

Edward Hallock's family are accounted for in the same census in Genesee County:
 
 {{% mefig "census/census-1875a-nys" "400" /%}}
 

## Future research

Edward seems to have been engaged in other work aside from the store and post office, or possibly working on behalf of Edward Lounsbery, as evidenced by the following:
