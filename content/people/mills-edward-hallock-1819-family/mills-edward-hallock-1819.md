This would seem to be the page and entry that Molly Adams mistook for a reference to Emily in "Town of Caroline" Chapter Two of <strong>The Towns of Tompkins County</strong>, Jane Marsh Dieckmann editor, 1998, p61-62: "From 1908 to 1925 an itinerant worker named George Jansen, who dug gardens, painted rooms or houses, washed dishes, or "kept house" when an owner went on a trip, recorded events in Brookton along with the daily weather. He noted the death of Emily Mills, who had continued her father's store for thirty years, extending credit to many needy individuals." George passed nearly two years before Emily.

Notes:

  - Variations of Edward's middle name exist, such as "Hallioch" and "Halloch" however these seem to be errors as Edward's middle name appears to be taken from his mother's maiden name: "Hallock."

### Notes for Future Researchers

There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. This appears to be a completely different family based on the following city directories that list family members who are unaccounted for in the Mills Genealogy and are not documented in anything else we know about the Mills.

The members of this family can just barely be made out in the [1875 New York State Census in Fulton County](census/census-1875-nysb). Edward Hallock's family are accounted for in the [same census in Genesee County](census/census-1875-nysa).
