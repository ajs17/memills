Edward Hallock Mills, born 25 Mar 1819, Smithtown NY, died 01 Jan 1908 Brookton, NY. Patriarch of the Mills family. Co-owner of [E. H. Mills & Co.]({{% ref "features/corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) general store in Corfu NY and owner of [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}) in Motts Corners/Brookton NY.

Note that the account of the Mills family's travels around the time of J. Thomas Mills' birth in 1827, as described in his obituary in the accompanying account of the Mills' [Long Island origins]({{% ref "genealogy" %}}), appears inconsistent with Edward's purported birthplace referenced in several sources, including the census. 

Edward was living in [Factoryville (West New Brighton) Staten Island]({{% ref "features/staten-island" %}}) by the time he married his first wife [Mary Ann Pine (1819-1895)]({{% ref "mills-mary-ann-1819" %}}) in 1850.

All of the Mills children were born in Staten Island, and by 1860, the family was living with Barlett Brown in a home adjoining a store Bartlett had recently purchased. Both Edward and Bartlett were among the proteges of local businessman Charles M. Pine.  

The family arrived in [Corfu NY]({{% ref "corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863. Edward was now co-owner of [E. H. Mills & Co.]({{% ref "features/corfu-eh-mills-co" %}}) "cash store".

[Horace]({{% ref "mills-horace-f-1854" %}}) committed suicide in Corfu in Oct 1876.

In Mar 1879, the family moved again, this time to Motts Corners, one of several earlier names for Brooktondale. At Motts Corners, Edward restarted his grocery and dry goods business on his own as [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}). Both [Jonas]({{% ref "mills-jonas-e-1852" %}}) and [Emily]({{% ref "mills-mary-emily-1858" %}}) clerked for their father. 

Edward's father Jonas died in 1882.

Edward's son Jonas died after a brief illness in Oct 1885.

Edward's obituary mentions that he was "postmaster during the Cleveland administration" which I can confirm refers to the first Cleveland administration from 1885 to 1889. (As this is written, Cleveland is the only president to have two non-consecutive terms.) A partial list of Brooktondale postmasters from usps.gov, beginning with the very first, up to the 1970's:

<blockquote>
William Mott II…deposed the postmaster [Willet Terry] at Terryville (on Coddington Road) and moved the post office to his store at 559 Brooktondale Road. The town, called Mott's Hollow or Mottville, became Mott's Corners with the opening of the post office in 1836.

Mary Ann passed on the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary. A year and two days later, Edward married [Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman (1824-1917)]({{% ref "mills-hannah-1824" %}}). Whether perhaps by superstition or some practical matter, the date chosen seems less likely to be a coincidence due to the fact that Edward joined the church on the third to last Sunday before the marriage ceremony.

Barbara Kone compiled information on Caroline Marriages at [CarolineHistorian.org](http://carolinehistorian.org) that lists Edward's marriage to Hannah and identifies Edward's parents:

Edward and Hannah joined the church just weeks before their wedding:

The following, taken from the sales journals of [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton, seems to indicate the family purchased a barn on 23 Sep 1907 and rented it to John Roe for $0.50 a month starting in 1908. I have not found a deed that corresponds to this date in the deed indexes for Caroline or Danby that are preserved by the Tompkins County Clerk. Interestingly, there is a real estate transaction between Amanda Lounsbery and John Roe earlier in 1907, that is perhaps related to the barn rental:

Edward also lent money to Samuel Onan and his wife for a land purchase, later transferring it to Culver Little, Edward Lounsbery's brother-in-law:

Emily officially joined the church rolls in the months immediately following Edward's illness. Emily is the first to note Edward's death in the sales journal of E. H. Mills general store, on an otherwise normal day of the store's operation:

## Notes for Future Researchers

There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. I have not investigated this family very much beyond ruling them out as the subjects of my research.

The members of the Gloversville Mills family can just barely be made out in the 1875 New York State Census in Fulton County:

Edward Hallock's family are accounted for in the same census in Genesee County:
