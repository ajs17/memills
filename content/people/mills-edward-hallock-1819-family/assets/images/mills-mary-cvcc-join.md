    - According to Mary Ann's obituary–that exists elsewhere in the cited volume, and which is reproduced alongside this material–the Mills moved to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879, yet Mary Ann does not join the Congregational Church until a year after that date. Assuming these dates are accurate, it could suggest that perhaps Edward (and Jonas?) moved to Mott's Corners ahead of Mary Ann and the rest of the family?
