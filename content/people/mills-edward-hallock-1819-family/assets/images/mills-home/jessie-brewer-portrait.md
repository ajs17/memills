Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took it over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed [step-]mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.
