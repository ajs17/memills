  - This photograph may show the veterans in front of Personius Hall at present day 559 Brooktondale Road. From Molly Adams' research notes in the Caroline History Room: "Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott's original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882." I don't know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. Walker Personius was also a charter member of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church.
