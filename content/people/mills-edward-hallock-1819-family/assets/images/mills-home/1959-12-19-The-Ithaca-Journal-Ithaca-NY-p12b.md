  - This photograph likely shows the veterans in front of Personius Hall at present day 559 Brooktondale Road. From Molly Adams' research notes in the Caroline History Room: "Walker Personius was a Civil War veteran and the village postmaster in 1882. He seems to have been the owner of Mott's original store which he called Personius Hall. The building had a large meeting space on the second floor, with seats that folded down from the wall. Memorial Day (then called Decoration Day) processions always formed in front of that building (see photo) and perhaps the David Ireland Post of Civil War Veterans met in that building. It seems clear that the post office was still at 559 Brooktondale Road in 1882." I don't know what photo was being referenced in the preceding passage. From "Tour 3 - P8" in A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline: "1st Post Office & store, left -- 559 Brooktondale Road. We think this building was build by Mr. Mott, who owned most of the land at that time. ...The G.A.R. lined up here to march to the [Quick, presently Brookton] cemetery to put flowers on the graves. There was a tannery between this house and the next before 1853 owned by Silsbury & [Edward] Lounsbery." Walker Personius and Edward Lounsbery were also charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners, presently called Caroline Valley Community Church, and were instrumental in its formation. George Richardson, who appears to have worked for Edward Mills at a time when Edward was Postmaster, eventually started his own grocery business in "the old Personius store" starting May 1897.
