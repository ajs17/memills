  - "This genealogy relates to the Suffolk County branch of the family, descendants of TIMOTHY MILLS who settled at Smithtown in 1683. The other branch remained at Jamaica. Members of both branches were fairly numerous during the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries, but now are greatly reduced." (p105.)

  - Another clue to Mary Hallock's identity can be seen here, as she appears to have a sister Sarah who married George Phillips Mills.
