    Notes:

    - Obviously, Edward's date of death is incorrect. The only connection with Jan 6 is the publication of his obituaries.
    
    - Given the innaccuracy with Edward's date of death, Horace's should be viewed with skepticism. as well. Presently, this is the only documentation of his death, so until evidence to the contrary is discovered, this will be assumed to be his death date.
