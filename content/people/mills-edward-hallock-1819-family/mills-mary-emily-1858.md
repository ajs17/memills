Emily was likely named for one of her ancestors, although, as the name Mary is quite common within both the Mills and Hallock families, there are several candidates for whom. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she would typically use "M. Emily Mills", particularly in later years.

There are only two primary sources that assert Emily's date of birth: her gravestone that states the year was 1861—which has since been the accepted date for obvious reasons—and an entry in the 1900 US census where Emily indicates it was "Dec 1858". The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily's lifetieme, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily's self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the "Computed birthyear" column above. Given that these were self-reported by Emily, and we don't know the origin of the (I might add, less specific) 1861 date (Emily may have died before making funeral arrangements), December 1858 seems the more accurate date and will be used going forward, implying the grave stone is in error.

Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily's exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. I am in contact with Calvary Presbyterian Church in Staten Island, which seems like the most likely candidate for the church that Mary Ann may have belonged to at the time, to see if they have birth records for her children.

We don't know exactly when the family moved to Corfu; census records indicate they were in Staten Island as late as 1859 and then E. H. Mills & Co. appears on 1866 maps of Corfu, alhtough perhaps the fact that E. H. Mills & Co. is in several places referred to generically as "Cash Store" indicates it was relatively new at that time.

Emily would return in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But it would seem that she also returned to visit her school friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.

The entry above appeared in the "Corfu Mentions." column for "Corfu, June 20" the date is presumably a mis-print.

The only thing we really know about Emily's earliest years in Mott's Corners/Brookton is that she was active in the local "lodge" of the Independent Order of Good Templars, a local temperance organization. 

And another glimpse into Emily's personal life:

Notes:

  - "Miss Esther Vorhis" is a reference to Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe (1893-1964) who descendents have confirmed went by Esther.  See also a Jan 28, 1960 article on p3 of The Ithaca Journal that references a "Mrs. Esther Vorhis Pancoe of Brooktondale." Esther was [baptized with Emily](#the-baptism-of-emily-mills), where she is listed as "C. Esther Vorhis" and she married George W. Pancoe (1895-1969) in 1918.

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on October 10, 1937. She would spend the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital where she died on November 3, at 78 years old, a few weeks shy of 79 years old..

Notes:

  - Although the age given here does not match any proposed birth year for Emily, it is still closer to 1858, being off by as little as 13 months from that year, and in fact errs on the side of being older still, further calling 1861 into question.

Notes:

  - This would seem to give Emily's correct age if she were born Dec 1858.

This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

{{% mefig "1937-11-11-ithaca-journal" "400" /%}}

The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, we can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily's first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn't know some of the most important aspects of Emily's life, most notably, her charity, One senses that the professor understood he was writing what would be the definitive statement of her life for the ages, and indeed, in several histories where Emily is mentioned, her only description consists of the text of this tribute, in its entirety, without further comment.

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.

Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" and prior to that, the location of M. E. Mills, is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})
  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

In the Caroline History Room, there is a copy of Molly's familiar-looking research notes that organizes her research on the Mills family and forms the basis of the more narrative "Note" above. Although largely a repetition of what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, this document is important as it contains further historical context and most importantly, indicates the sources of the quotes in the "Note":

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills-research-notes" /%}}

The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the "Note" that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily.

### Gertrude Conant's Recollections

Notes:

  - Dr. Benjamin Lockwood's house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, "Dr. Mary" Ridgway Tinker would live and practice there for a time. He was also a member of Brookton Congregational and built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920's. After Dr. Lockwood's death, E. D. Shurter placed a plaque in his honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.
  - The "woman who lived in and kept house" whose name Gertrude couldn't remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.

### The Baptism of Emily Mills

Emily Mills and Jessie Shurter were baptized in the same ceremony, officiated by none other than the Reverend Annis Ford Eastman.

Notes:

  - The uneven pen strokes and differences in intensity of ink show that the original record was written in fountain pen, with the lighter, marginal notes added later with lead pencil. The consistency of the pencil marks suggests these notes were all added at the same time.

In 1907, April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter. It was to be the final year of Edward's life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward's health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.

It is interesting to note the care taken to quote the scripture verse used in the sermon, as it is a translation that uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:

<figure>
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.

  - Despite how it appears on her tombstone, Alleine was married to Harry Van Order (1891-1918) first on Dec 17, 1910, then married William Lyman Peck (1875-1960) on Jan 23, 1935.
  - Louise Ward (Shurter) Henderson is the neice of E. D. Shurter.

I could not find an account of this baptism in the Ithaca Journal, but there is this entry over a week later in the Elmira Gazette and Free Press, that, despite some glaring innaccuracies that can be explained, appears to reference the event:

Notes:

  - Brookton was often confused with Brocton and even Brooklyn, and that is the reason for adopting the name Brooktondale. See [Historical Names](#historical-names). Otherwise, the use of "village" doesn't make sense.
  - It is referencing the wrong weekend, but it is also a relative time reference, and perhaps the difference is just a result of the text not being updated in the time between writing and its delayed publishing.
  - The reference to the Denmans would seem to be Richard L. Denman (1848-1915) and his wife Adelaide (1852-1947).  At this time, Richard was a trustee of the church.

At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily's mother Mary Ann was the only one in the family on the Church rolls, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. During the Reverend's tenure, she would also give occassional public lectures at the Congregational Church. In the Reverend's account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who "waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me." (From **Enjoyment of Living** by Max Eastman, pg 70.)

### More information about Emily's Baptism 

**Reverend Annis Ford Eastman** officiated the ceremony. She made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in "The Making of a Woman Minister" in the book **Enjoyment of Living** by her son Max Eastman. The Church's historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the "picked council" she refers to in her account. The Church's records indicate that the Reverend did return to Brookton periodically in the years after she left. The Reverend would die in 1910 after a period of ill health, so this would have been one of her last return visits to Brookton.

The Deacons listed are:

  - **[Cantine Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338791/cantine-lounsbery)** (1831-1910)
  - **[Harvey Smiley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24763291/harvey-smiley)** (?-1917)
  - **[Orange Munson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/95123044/orange-munson)** (1834-1910):
      - Via findagrave.com: "Orange, the son of Joseph, was born Aug 4 1834; married Mary (his 2nd cousin) Feb 18 1855; and after her death he married Johanna Ada Richardson. He was a farmer in 1880. They resided in Brookton, NY [Src: Munson Record V2. Myron Munson. p. 1091, 1112]" Caroline Valley Community Church records from the time have a record of Orange and Ada Munson moving to Erin NY Aug 30, 1918 and needing a letter to transfer to the Methodist Church there.

Selected data on the participants:

**Jessie (Shurter) Brewer (1881-1974)**

  - Married Lewis William Brewer (1882-1963).
  - As mentioned in [A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), Jessie (Shurter) Brewer grew up in the Shurter House next to M. E. Mills and she would eventually purchase the Mills' home and M. E. Mills after Emily's death.


**Susie C. (Westfall) Lawrence (1885-1977)**

  - Married Woodley Lawrence (1885-1931).


**Lettie Delphene Personius (1892-1909)**

  - Lettie Personius, aged 16 years, died at City Hospital yesterday of gangrenous appendicitis. Miss Personious was the daughter of Postmaster Jacob Wilson Personius (1866-1906) of Caroline Depot, who was killed by a Lackawanna freight train near his home on Dec. 14, 1906. 

**Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe (1893-1964)**

  - Descendents confirm she commonly went by Esther.
  - Married George W. Pancoe (1895-1969).
