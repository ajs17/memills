Emily was likely named for one of her ancestors, although, as the name Mary is quite common within both the Mills and Hallock families, there are several candidates for whom. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she would typically use "M. Emily Mills", particularly in later years.

There are only two primary sources that assert Emily's date of birth: her gravestone that states the year was 1861—which has since been the accepted date for obvious reasons—and an entry in the 1900 US census where Emily indicates it was "Dec 1858". The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily's lifetieme, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily's self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the "Computed birthyear" column above. Given that these were self-reported by Emily, and we don't know the origin of the (I might add, less specific) 1861 date (Emily may have died before making funeral arrangements), December 1858 seems the more accurate date and will be used going forward, implying the grave stone is in error.

Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily's exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. I am in contact with Calvary Presbyterian Church in Staten Island, which seems like the most likely candidate for the church that Mary Ann may have belonged to at the time, to see if they have birth records for her children.

We don't know exactly when the family moved to Corfu; census records indicate they were in Staten Island as late as 1859 and then E. H. Mills & Co. appears on 1866 maps of Corfu, alhtough perhaps the fact that E. H. Mills & Co. is in several places referred to generically as "Cash Store" indicates it was relatively new at that time.

Emily would return in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But it would seem that she also returned to visit her school friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.

The entry above appeared in the "Corfu Mentions." column for "Corfu, June 20" the date is presumably a mis-print.

The only thing we really know about Emily's earliest years in Mott's Corners/Brookton is that she was active in the local "lodge" of the Independent Order of Good Templars, a local temperance organization. 

And another glimpse into Emily's personal life:

Notes:

  - "Miss Esther Vorhis" is a reference to Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe (1893-1964) who descendents have confirmed went by Esther.  See also a Jan 28, 1960 article on p3 of The Ithaca Journal that references a "Mrs. Esther Vorhis Pancoe of Brooktondale." Esther was [baptized with Emily](#the-baptism-of-emily-mills), where she is listed as "C. Esther Vorhis" and she married George W. Pancoe (1895-1969) in 1918.

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on October 10, 1937. She would spend the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital where she died on November 3, at 78 years old, a few weeks shy of 79 years old..

Notes:

  - Although the age given here does not match any proposed birth year for Emily, it is still closer to 1858, being off by as little as 13 months from that year, and in fact errs on the side of being older still, further calling 1861 into question.

Notes:

  - This would seem to give Emily's correct age if she were born Dec 1858.
  - According to an entry in the [Late August - Early September 2016 edition of the **History Happenings** newsletter published by the Tompkins County History Center](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/History-Happenings---Late-August---Early-September-2016.html?soid=1103133034468&aid=9svvB-OfDhg), "January 1914 Ithaca Memorial Hospital opened on Quarry Street and in January 1948 responsibility was assumed by Tompkins County and renamed as Tompkins County Memorial Hospital." This building today is owned by Cornell University and used for student dormitories.

This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

{{% mefig "1937-11-11-ithaca-journal" "400" /%}}

The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, we can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily's first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn't know some of the most important aspects of Emily's life, most notably, her charity, One senses that the professor understood he was writing what would be the definitive statement of her life for the ages, and indeed, in several histories where Emily is mentioned, her only description consists of the text of this tribute, in its entirety, without further comment.

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.

Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" and prior to that, the location of M. E. Mills, is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})
  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

In the Caroline History Room, there is a copy of Molly's familiar-looking research notes that organizes her research on the Mills family and forms the basis of the more narrative "Note" above. Although largely a repetition of what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, this document is important as it contains further historical context and most importantly, indicates the sources of the quotes in the "Note":

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills-research-notes" /%}}

The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the "Note" that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily.

### Gertrude Conant's Recollections

Notes:

  - Dr. Benjamin Lockwood's house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, "Dr. Mary" Ridgway Tinker would live and practice there for a time. He was also a member of Brookton Congregational and built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920's. After Dr. Lockwood's death, E. D. Shurter placed a plaque in his honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.
  - The "woman who lived in and kept house" whose name Gertrude couldn't remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.
