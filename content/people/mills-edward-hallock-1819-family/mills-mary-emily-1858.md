Mary Emily Mills, born Dec 1858 Staten Island, NY, died 03 Nov 1937 Brooktondale NY, who went by Emily, was the youngest child of Edward H. and Mary Ann Mills. Proprietor of [**M. E. Mills**]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton/Brooktondale NY. Active in the [temperance movement]({{% ref "features/temperance" %}}) in the Independent Order of Good Templars and the Women's Christian Temperance Union, as well as Sunday School teacher and piano player in Brooktonale Congregational Church. She was highly regarded as a cheerful, kind, and charitable person.

Emily was likely named for one of her ancestors, although, as the name Mary is quite common within both the Mills and Hallock families, there are several candidates for whom. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she would typically use "M. Emily Mills", particularly in later years.

The date of birth on Emily's headstone is incorrect:

{{% mefig "today/grave-emily/feature" "700" /%}}

She is listed with her family in the 1860 Federal Census:

{{% mefig "census/census-1860-us" "700" /%}}

Furthermore, in her entry in the 1900 US census, Emily indicates her birth date is "Dec 1858". The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily's lifetieme, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily's self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the "Computed birthyear" column above. Given that these were self-reported by Emily, and we don't know the origin of the (I might add, less specific) 1861 date (Emily likely died before making her own funeral arrangements, and like her father, she died without a will), December 1858 seems the more accurate date and will be used going forward, implying the grave stone is in error.

{{% mefig "census/census-1900-us-inset" "700" /%}}

I have been in contact with two people at Brookton Cemetery who have both looked into the matter, and they each confirmed that the only information they have on Emily is the name and plot number "and what is on the headstone". There is no indication who made the funeral arrangements for Emily, who the plot was sold to, or any information that might shed light on the erroneous birth year. 

Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily's exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. I am in contact with Calvary Presbyterian Church in Staten Island, which seems the most likely candidate for the church that Mary Ann may have belonged to at the time, to see if they have birth records for her children. I have also submitted a reference question to the staff of the Presbyterian Historical Society.

We don't know exactly when the family moved to Corfu; census records indicate they were in Staten Island in the Summer of 1860, and then by the Summer of 1863, Edward is listed in the Civil War Draft Registration Records as living in Pembroke, and E. H. Mills & Co. next appears on 1866 maps of Corfu, although perhaps the fact that E. H. Mills & Co. is in several places referred to generically as "Cash Store" indicates it was relatively new at that time. Bartlett Brown's marriage and Charles Pine's timeline might also give us clues to when they moved.

Emily would return to Corfu in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But it would seem that she also returned to visit her school friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.

{{% mefig "1882-07-21-batavia-daily-news" "400" /%}}

The only thing we really know about Emily's earliest years in Mott's Corners/Brookton is that she was active in the local "lodge" of the temperance organization, the [Independent Order of Good Templars]({{% ref "features/temperance" %}}). At least by the 1890's, Emily was working as a clerk in her father's store.

Emily was at times the recording and corresponding secretary for the Good Templars, and through the preservation of a book of their meeting minutes, we have many examples of Emily's handwriting from this time. 

{{% mefig "temperance/1886-04-23" "700" /%}}

There are also a number of volumes of sales journals from [M. E. Mills]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}) in Emily's handwriting (and certainly Ellen Gould's handwriting must also be present in those books). 

{{% mefig "handwriting/sig3" "700" /%}}

<div class="gallery">
  {{% mefig "handwriting/sig1" "300" /%}}
  {{% mefig "handwriting/sig2" "300" /%}}
</div>

A number of aspects of Emily's handwriting are quite distinctive—such as uppercase E's, M's, W's, C's, T's and F's as well as lowercase p's are often written with similar idiosyncracies. Note for example, the following entry in M. E. Mills sales journals, a close examination of which will reveal is entirely written by Emily. Notice how even though she is writing the same word on the same day, from one entry to the next, how she writes her uppercase T can vary in one of two ways, each quite distinctive in itself. It can either swoop down from the top and finish with a flourishing loop behind it, or can be two strokes of the pen, one down, and the cross rises and falls, the opposite of the cross in the other T. Notice that on James Caveney's entry, we get the flourishing T, but the capital F afterward on the same line item shows the mushroom cap shape characteristic of her other style of writing T:  

{{% mefig "me-mills/1909-03-26-sales-journal" "700" /%}}

Her E's C's L's and J's tend to have big loops. Her lowercase p's practically pierce the line above it. And of course, her T's and F's have those distinctive crosses. Her handwriting is easily recognizable, and when others (most likely Ellen Gould) make entries in the Mill's store journals, it sticks out.

Here we get a small glimpse of Emily's personal life:

{{% mefig "mills-emily-arthurs-home-magazine" "300" /%}}

{{% mefig "1895-12-31-daily-news-p1" "700" /%}}

In 1907, Emily would officially join the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church, along with 10 other single women, in a ceremony officiated by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman. Less than a year later, her father would pass and she would make another heartbreaking trip to Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Corfu.

{{% mefig "mills-emily-cvcc-baptism" "700" "img,blockquote,figcaption" /%}}

A closer examination of the circumstances around the baptism can be found [here]({{% ref "baptism" %}}).

Emily played the piano (and/or organ) in the Church and at times served as an officer in the Church. She was a Sunday School teacher, and possibly taught classes specifically for adults. There are accounts of her organizing bible study groups and prayer meetings in her home. It is unclear what Emily's religious outlook was before being baptized, but at least from that point on, Emily's faith was a very important part of her life. 

Emily continued to be involved in temperance, for some period of time, a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, along with her step-mother Hannah. This is almost certainly unknowable now, but I have wondered if Hannah was introduced to Edward through the Emily's involvement with the W. C. T. U.

</div>

Edward died "intestate", without a will, and until 02 August 1909, Emily and Hannah worked with their lawyer Fordyce Cobb to become official legal co-owners of the Mills Home and Mills Store. Emily followed her father's example and renamed the store *M. E. Mills*. When Hannah passed less than a decade later, Emily would inherit the home and store.

Thanks to Gertrude Conant's personal recollections, we have a basic description of Emily's appearance and personality:

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Bacon’s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.

...I remember her as very kind...

And of course E. D. Shurter's words endure as the definitive summation of Emily's life:

<figure class="quote-only">
<blockquote>
Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly...she went about her daily round of duties with a Christian fortitude and faithfulness...
</blockquote>

These descriptions of Emily's demeanor are consistent with the personal recollections of a current Brooktondale resident, currently in her 90's who has early childhood memories of Emily and her store in the last years of Emily's life.

Due to the level of detail given to the context of this story, I am choosing to include the entire text and not just Emily's section:

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on 10 Oct 1937. She would spend the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital in Ithaca where she died on November 3, at 78 years old, a few weeks shy of 79 years old.

This moving tribute was authored by E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

{{% mefig "1937-11-11-ithaca-journal" "400" /%}}

The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, we can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily's first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn't fully appreciate some of the most important aspects of Emily's life, most notably, her charity, One senses that the professor understood he was writing what would be the definitive statement of her life for the ages, and indeed, in several histories where Emily is mentioned, her only description consists of the text of this tribute, in its entirety, without further comment. 

The professor makes it clear that charity was one of Emily's defining characteristics. The news clippings above give a sense of her contributions to the Red Cross, and of course, the W. C. T. U. did considerable charitable work. We have many sales journals of [M. E. Mills general store]({{% ref "features/me-mills" %}}) and know that it was common practice for Emily's customers to have accounts that they likely paid monthly. The professor seems to indicate that perhaps she allowed more time for payment to those who needed it. We can also see evidence here and there of direct donations from her store that she counted against her own account as "Goods for Charity":

{{% mefig "me-mills/1909-03-26-emily-mills-entry-p554" "700" /%}}

There are also entries in the historical records of Caroline Valley Federated Church of extra donations made to the church by both Hannah and Emily among other members. By agreement with the Church, I have not reproduced any financial records here.

## Other Historical Accounts

Understandably, histories of the Mills family have typically focused almost exclusively on Emily. All previous secondary sources of information on Emily accepted 1861 as her birth year.

Emily is mentioned twice by Molly Adams in her chapter *Town of Caroline* in **The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs** edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann:

<blockquote class="quote_only">
...[George Jansen] noted the death of Emily Mills, who had continued her father's store for thirty years, extending credit to many needy individuals. (p62)
</blockquote>

As indicated elsewhere, George Jansen predeceased Emily by two years. The entry that Molly must have been referring to is the mention of Edward's death:

{{% mefig "george-jansen-ehmills-entry" "400" "img,cite" /%}}

And in the following, Molly seems to indicate that "at the store" was referring to what we know today as Brookton's Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at that time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but its not obvious that this isn't referring to Mills' store:

<blockquote class="quote_only">
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub. ... Jessie Brewer sold dry goods and had a lending library where Emily Mill's store had been. *— Molly Adams, "Town of Caroline" in **The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs** edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, p63*
</blockquote>

The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, on the southwest corner of the former grist mill lot, directly across the street from the former location of Mill's store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. 

{{% mefig "lockwood-memorial" "400" /%}}

Emily is not mentioned by name, but is implicitly referenced in a photo caption of a portrait of Jessie Brewer published in 2016, "Around Caroline" by Patricia A. Brhel, p23:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.
</blockquote>

Gertrude Conant's personal recollections provide valuable details, including physical descriptions of Emily and her store as well as reflections on her personality. If not for Gertrude, these precious details would be long forgotten.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew. Despite its title, this exceptional account is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself. As I've done my own research, it does seem that much of what we know about Emily is in relation to the store in some way, and perhaps that is to be expected.

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills" "700" /%}}

In the Caroline History Room, there is a copy of Molly's familiar-looking research notes that organizes her research on the Mills family and forms the basis of the more narrative "Note" above. Although largely a repetition of what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, this document is important as it contains further historical context and most importantly, indicates the sources of the quotes in the "Note" as well as the fact that the "leatherette booklet" was accessioned by the History Room. It also shows that Gertrude taught Molly much of what she knew about M. E. Mills in particular

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills-research-notes" "700" /%}}

The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the "Note" that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner of the Mills Home would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily. 

The answer to Molly's question "and some groceries?" seems to be yes. Perhaps the question arose because Jessie Brewer apparently did not continue to sell groceries, and this was what residents of the time would more likely remember.

Molly Adams also wrote about Emily in "Town of Caroline" a chapter in the book "The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs" edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, 1998. Emily is also mentioned in Town of Caroline Historian Barbara Kone's compilation "A History of the Town of Caroline, Tompkins County, New York, United States of America" known to us all as "The Bicentennial Book."

"A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline" sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995 contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as "Tour 4 - P7" in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and is the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her "Note". In Molly's research notes, she gives the attribution: "[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I confirmed with Barbara Kone that Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
<strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>

This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back postoffice has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.
</blockquote>

(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)

*M. E. Mills* is listed as a "present merchant" in The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village".

Emily, Edward, and Hannah are mentioned in the diaries of George Jansen. Edward's death is noted, as is Hannah's final illness and death. George notes in a number of entries throughout the years that he did odd jobs for Emily, two specific examples are "drawing a cord of wood" and some painting that context would suggest was for the store. I have done a complete photo inventory of the six notebooks of George Jansen's that are currently owned by the Tompkins County History Center in Ithaca, and I will add images and transcriptions to this record as I am able to process them.

## Notes for Future Researchers

In Gertrude Conant's recollections, she notes that Ellen Gould "looked a great deal like Miss Mills," so when looking for photos of either woman, one must be cautious not to mis-identify one for the other.

I believe there is ample contextual evidence to suggest that Emily was a member of the Ladies Aid Society and also involved in some capacity with the Red Cross, although I don't believe I have direct evidence of these. 

My own speculation after reading many of the Ithaca Journal "gossip columns" from Emily's lifetime is that there may be a good probability that Emily, or someone very close to Emily was the author during a period that included the final years of Hannah's life. The fact that Hannah was written of so much and in such glowing terms, and just the tone and subtle phrasing of references to the Hannah's life and in other entries that reference the Mills store. I realize I am trying to see this connection, but to me the wording suggests a disciplined detachment. 

For example, in an article ostensibly about the W. C. T. U., it is instead really reporting about the activities of Hannah, seeing the event from her perspective. It talks of her daily life doing chores, but never mentions she lives with her daughter. Perhaps these can all be explained as the expected result of the brutally efficient nature of newspaper writing, then assuming it was written by a professional Journal staff writer. (The headlines, such as the one that includes "yet does housework" certainly suggests it was written by an editor, but this would have been common practice regardless of the author.)

Typically, the gossip columns had a default headline of the area, in this case "Brookton" or occassionally "Brookton Heights". However, there are times when a bigger headline would be added emphasizing one aspect of the column. These would have the initial appearance of a typical newspaper article, but then you see it is the relevant gossip column for that day, with perhaps a little more detail on the topic mentioned in the headline. This was the case with a few of Hannah's entries.

(In an informal discussion on the topic with Barbara Kone, it seems unlikely that "Brookton Heights" was ever a name used in the community. Those columns are indeed about the people of Brookton, and Barbara suggested that adding "Heights" was someone's attempt to dress up the name.)

These gossip columns, it is my understanding, were written by people local to the areas they were reporting on, and over time, you can sense a shift in style, level of detail, who is reported on, etc. that suggest periodic changes in authorship. Brookton was not an enormous community, so this its not highly improbable that Emily could have been the author. Someone who spends all day every day at the center of the community, within one of its active hubs would be well placed to observe people's actvivities.

Further, consider these:

  - Emily was "Superintendent of Literature and Publications" for the W. C. T. U. Why that position?
  - Consider how the store and church are mentioned, perhaps most notably, in the column where the glasses were left at the Congregational Church, and could be retrieved at M. E. Mills.

Keep in mind that we have examples of Emily writing in longer form, albeit in very specific contexts:

  - The meeting minutes of the Good Templars that she recorded.
  - Presumably she wrote Hannah's obituary.

Beginning with the Templars minutes, we can start to look for patterns of phrasing, etc. that might be used to identify her unattributed words elsewhere.

In an informal discussion about the gossip columns with Donna Eschenbrenner, it sounds like that The Ithaca Journal significantly downsized in the recent past, some of their records were sent to their parent company in Binghamton, while the rest were simply discarded, so it is very unlikely that any record of who the various "gossip column" authors were still exists.  I have tried to contact the Ithaca Journal to follow up on possible records but have not been able to get a response back.

Finally, I would like to point out the obvious role that Jessie Brewer played in preserving at least some of the information available here. She appears to have purchased all of Emily's personal and real property at auction, so she was the first link the chain of custody for some of these items. 

Consider for example that the 1917 book stands out from the others which are all many years later. Isn't it curious that to my knowledge, this is the only documentation proving that Emily had been a member of the Union? (Although the gossip columns covering Hanna and Ellen strongly suggest she was, as we would expect her to be anyway.) I made note of the accession information from the Tompkins County History Center but there was no obvious connection to Emily or Jessie, but I suspect that this could have originally been in Emily's and then Jessie's possession.

For the Good Templars meeting notebook according to Donna Eschenbrenner "Unfortunately we don't have an accession number on that ledger, so we don't know the donor." But again, I believe this was a possession of Emily's for many decades. She was the secretary for the final entry in the notebook, and the related items, forms, correspondences, etc., are all in Emily's hand, very strongly indicating that she was the last active member of the Templars to possess the notebook. 

The final entry on 27 Aug 1886 seems routine, and there is no indication that the group was disbanding. The fact that there are correspondences and forms along with the notebooks could be an indication of unfinished work in progress, but of course all of this assumes that the letters and correspondences were together and not donated independently. But I believe that based on what we have, a compelling case can be made that at least some of these items were in Emily's possession for many decades. 

Assuming that Emily had these items in her possession when she died then it would logically follow that Jessie Brewer had the next hand in preserving these items. And if this argument holds, then this may give us insight into the depth of their relationship, intertwined over many years. Now Jessie had purchased all of Emily's property, and she must have been deeply moved to see Emily's distinctive handwriting and so, she made a point of saving these items. And of course, having purchased Emily's store, Jessie Brewer was initially responsible for preserving the sales journals of M. E. Mills, and perhaps when they were finally removed from the basement, they were still in the place that Jessie had put them years before.
