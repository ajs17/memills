Emily was likely named for one of her ancestors, although, as the name Mary is quite common within both the Mills and Hallock families, there are several candidates for whom. Presumably she went by Emily in casual circumstances to distinguish her from her mother, and in more formal contexts, she would typically use "M. Emily Mills", particularly in later years.

The date of birth on Emily's headstone is incorrect:

{{% mefig "today/grave-emily/feature" /%}}

She is listed with her family in the 1860 Federal Census:

{{% mefig "census/census-1860-us" /%}}

Furthermore, in her entry in the 1900 US census, Emily indicates her birth date is "Dec 1858". The census data I have seen is presently limited to what is available online through ancestry.com, but among those I was able to find during Emily's lifetieme, only the 1900 census asked for month and year of birth, while all others, including 1900, simply ask for age at last birthday. Census' were typically done in May or June of the appropriate years, and Emily's self reported age in each census consistently resolves to 1858 as indicated in the "Computed birthyear" column above. Given that these were self-reported by Emily, and we don't know the origin of the (I might add, less specific) 1861 date (Emily may have died before making funeral arrangements), December 1858 seems the more accurate date and will be used going forward, implying the grave stone is in error.

{{% mefig "census/census-1900-us-inset" /%}}

I have been in contact with two people at Brookton Cemetery who have both looked into the matter, and they both confirm that the only information they have on Emily is the name and plot number "and what is on the headstone". There is no indication who made the funeral arrangements for Emily, who the plot was sold to, or any information that might shed light on the erroneous birth year. 

Further research will obviously need to be done, but ultimately, Emily's exact date of birth (and that of her brothers) may be lost, as she was born during a notoriously bad period for the recording and preservation of birth records. I am in contact with Calvary Presbyterian Church in Staten Island, which seems like the most likely candidate for the church that Mary Ann may have belonged to at the time, to see if they have birth records for her children. I have also submitted a reference question to the staff of the Presbyterian Historical Society.

We don't know exactly when the family moved to Corfu; census records indicate they were in Staten Island in the Summer of 1860 and then E. H. Mills & Co. appears on 1866 maps of Corfu, although perhaps the fact that E. H. Mills & Co. is in several places referred to generically as "Cash Store" indicates it was relatively new at that time. Bartlett Brown's marriage and Charles Pine's timeline might also give us clues to when they moved.

Emily would return to Corfu in later years to bury Jonas, Mary Ann and Edward. But it would seem that she also returned to visit her school friends, at least this one time, surely with many mixed emotions.

The only thing we really know about Emily's earliest years in Mott's Corners/Brookton is that she was active in the local "lodge" of the [Independent Order of Good Templars]({{% ref "features/temperance" %}}), a local temperance organization. At least by the 1890's, she was working as a clerk in her father's store.

And another glimpse into Emily's personal life:

{{% mefig "mills-emily-arthurs-home-magazine" "400" /%}}

{{% mefig "1895-12-31-daily-news-p1" /%}}

In 1907, Emily would officially join the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church, along with 10 other single women, in a ceremony officiated by Reverend Annis Ford Eastman. Less than a year later, her father would pass and she would make another heartbreaking trip to Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Corfu.

{{% mefig "1908-01-06-batavia-daily-news-p4" "400" /%}}

Edward died "intestate", without a will, and until 02 August 1909, Emily and Hannah worked with their lawyer Fordyce Cobb to become official legal co-owners of the Mills Home and Mills Store. Emily followed her father's example and renamed the store *M. E. Mills*. When Hannah passed less than a decade later, Emily would inherit everything.

Thanks to Gertrude Conant's personal recollections, we have a basic description of Emily's appearance and personality:

<figure>
<blockquote>
Emily Mills was a little woman, with her hair in a bun on top of her head, like Grandma Baconâ€™s. She was quiet, neat, cheerful and always smiling.

...I remember her as very kind...
</blockquote>

These descriptions of Emily's demeanor are consistent with the personal recollections of a current Brooktondale resident, currently in her 90's who has early childhood memories of Emily and her store in the last years of Emily's life.

Due to the level of detail given to the context of this story, I am choosing to include the entire text and not just Emily's section:

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brooktondale Congregational Church on October 10, 1937. She would spend the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital where she died on November 3, at 78 years old, a few weeks shy of 79 years old..

This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

{{% mefig "1937-11-11-ithaca-journal" "400" /%}}

The professor clearly took great care in crafting this tribute, and with the pacing of the final sentence, we can sense the weight of responsibility he felt representing the sense of loss of an entire community who held Emily in equally high esteem. He is Emily's first and most eloquent biographer, without whom we wouldn't know some of the most important aspects of Emily's life, most notably, her charity, One senses that the professor understood he was writing what would be the definitive statement of her life for the ages, and indeed, in several histories where Emily is mentioned, her only description consists of the text of this tribute, in its entirety, without further comment.

## Other Historical Accounts

Understandably, histories of the Mills family have typically focused almost exclusively on Emily. All previous secondary sources of information on Emily accepted 1861 as her birth year.

Emily is not mentioned by name, but is referenced in a photo caption of a portrait of Jessie Brewer published in 2016, "Around Caroline" by Patricia A. Brhel, p23:

<blockquote>
Jesse Brewer ran a dry goods store in Brooktondale, selling fabric, ribbon, greeting cards, and other items. She took over from a woman who had managed a grocery store in the same building and used the proceeds from the store to increase the family income and help support her widowed mother. She was also active in the Caroline Valley Federated (now Community) Church.
</blockquote>

Gertrude Conant's personal recollections provide valuable details, including physical descriptions of Emily and her store as well as reflections on her personality. If not for Gertrude, these precious details would be long forgotten.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew. Despite its title, this exceptional account is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills" /%}}

In the Caroline History Room, there is a copy of Molly's familiar-looking research notes that organizes her research on the Mills family and forms the basis of the more narrative "Note" above. Although largely a repetition of what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, this document is important as it contains further historical context and most importantly, indicates the sources of the quotes in the "Note" as well as the fact that the "leatherette booklet" was accessioned by the History Room. It also shows that Gertrude taught Molly much of what she knew about M. E. Mills in particular

{{% mefig "a-note-on-emily-mills-research-notes" /%}}

The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the "Note" that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner of the Mills Home would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily. 

The answer to MOlly's question "and some groceries?" seems to be yes. Perhaps the question arose because Jessie Brewer apparently did not continue to sell groceries, and this was what residents if the time would more likely remember.

Molly Adams also wrote about Emily in "Town of Caroline" a chapter in the book "The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs" edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, 1998. Emily is also mentioned in Town of Caroline Historian Barbara Kone's compilation "A History of the Town of Caroline, Tompkins County, New York, United States of America" known to us all as "The Bicentennial Book."

"A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline" sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995 contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as "Tour 4 - P7" in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and is the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her "Note". In Molly's research notes, she gives the attribution: "[Driveby, ie Conant]":

<blockquote>
<strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>

This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.

The postoffice has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.
</blockquote>

(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)

*M. E. Mills* is listed as a "present merchant" in The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village".

Emily, Edward, and Hannah are mentioned in the diaries of George Jansen. 

## Notes for Future Researchers

In Gertrude Conant's recollections, she notes that Ellen Gould "looked a great deal like Miss Mills," so when looking for photos of either woman, one must be cautious not to mis-identify one for the other.
