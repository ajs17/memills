This publication attempts to document all extant information on the family of Edward H. Mills (1819 to 1908), with particular emphasis on Emily Mills (1858 to 1937) and the family's time in Brooktondale (formerly known as Brookton, and before that, Mott's Corners).

## Census Data

The following represents a summary of all of the census data that I have been able to access. 

{{% table "census-data.csv" "census-all" "year,type,town,name,age,birthplace,occupation,industry" "*United States Federal Census* and *New York, U.S., State Census* accessed via [ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com)" %}}

According to [newyorkfamilyhistory.org](https://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/):
    
<blockquote class="quote-only">
<p>The second Constitution of the State of New York, written in 1821, required that a state census be taken in 1825 and every ten years after that - censuses were then taken every ten years until 1875. </p>

<p>Due to a number of political and bureaucratic conflicts, no state census was taken in 1885 - New York State wound up taking a census in 1892, skipped the census which should have occurred in 1895, and then resumed census-taking every ten years in the fifth year of each decade - 1905, 1915, and 1925. The state census was officially abolished in 1931, so the 1925 state census is the last one that exists. </p>

<p>...In 1911, a fire in New York's State Capitol, Albany, destroyed an enormous amount of crucial historical and genealogical records. </p>
