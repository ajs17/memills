## Census Data

The following represents a summary of all of the data that I have been able to access. 

{{% metable "census-data.csv" "census-all" "year,type,town,name,age,birthplace,occupation,industry" "**United States Federal Census** and **New York, U.S., State Census** accessed via [ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com)" %}}

According to [newyorkfamilyhistory.org](https://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/):
<blockquote class="quote-only">
The second Constitution of the State of New York, written in 1821, required that a state census be taken in 1825 and every ten years after that - censuses were then taken every ten years until 1875. 

Due to a number of political and bureaucratic conflicts, no state census was taken in 1885 - New York State wound up taking a census in 1892, skipped the census which should have occurred in 1895, and then resumed census-taking every ten years in the fifth year of each decade - 1905, 1915, and 1925. The state census was officially abolished in 1931, so the 1925 state census is the last one that exists. 

...In 1911, a fire in New York's State Capitol, Albany, destroyed an enormous amount of crucial historical and genealogical records.
