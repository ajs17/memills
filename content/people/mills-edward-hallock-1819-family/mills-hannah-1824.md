The 1896 New York State Marriage Index also traces Hannah back to her maiden name, with the identfication number 25877:

Edward and Hannah joined the church just weeks before their wedding:

My impressions of Hannah are that she was an active and outgoing woman who was much loved in the community.

Hannah's visit with Reverend Bogardus is her last meaningful trip outside the home documented. [Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus (1843-1925)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus) was also postmaster of the White Church postoffice, from 27 Aug 1886 to 05 Jul 1892. He later officiated Hannah's funeral.

A few months later, Hannah became ill and the first mentions of [Ellen Gould]({{% ref "gould-ellen" %}}) as Hannah's caretaker appear. It seems quite probable that this is an accounting of the circumstances of Ellen coming to live in the Mills home, to care for Emily's elderly step-mother which Emily herself, as a business owner, would not have had adequate time to do. Ellen was presumably already well known to the Mills as she was also a member of the W.C.T.U.

At this time, there is a marked increase in the number of prayer and temperance meetings held in the Mills home, presumably to accommodate Hannah's inability to attend events outside the home. Hannah was clearly viewed as an important community leader to these women.

Hannah died 25 Feb 1917, and her funeral was held within the Mills Home. There is no direct indication that her death was related to the Influenza pandemic of that time.

As one would expect, George Jansen also noted that Hannah's step-son Cyrus Eastman died shortly after her:
