Barbara Kone compiled information on Caroline Marriages at [CarolineHistorian.org](http://carolinehistorian.org) that lists Edward's marriage to Hannah and identifies Edward's parents:

My impressions of Hannah are that she was an active and outgoing woman who was much loved in the community.

Hannah apparently had what must have been of very worrying health episode. This is the first mention I have found of [Ellen Gould]({{% ref "gould-ellen" %}}), and it seems quite probable that this is an accounting of the circumstances of her coming to live in the Mills Home, to care for Emily's elderly step-mother which Emily herself, as a business owner, would not have had adequate time to do. Ellen was already well known to the Mills as she was also a member of the W.C.T.U.
