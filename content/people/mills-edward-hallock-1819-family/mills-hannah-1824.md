Edward and Hannah joined the church just weeks before their wedding:

My impressions of Hannah are that she was an active and outgoing woman who was much loved in the community.

[Reverend Elder Charles Bogardus (1843-1925)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98809451/charles-bogardus) was also postmaster of the White Church postoffice, from 27 Aug 1886 to 5 Jul 1892. He would eventually officiate Hannah's funeral. 

Hannah apparently had what must have been of very worrying health episode. This is the first mention I have found of [Ellen Gould]({{% ref "gould-ellen" %}}), and it seems quite probable that this is an accounting of the circumstances of her coming to live in the Mills Home, to care for Emily's elderly step-mother which Emily herself, as a business owner, would not have had adequate time to do. Ellen was already well known to the Mills as she was also a member of the W.C.T.U.

Hannah died, and her funeral was subsequently held, within the Mills Home.

As one would expect, George Jansen also noted that Hannah's step-son Cyrus Eastman died shortly after her:
