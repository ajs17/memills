In accordance with action taken by the Caroline Development Council at its last monthly meeting, subscriptions are being solicited from the citizens of the Town of Caroline for a memorial tablet as a mark of appreciation of the life and services of Dr. B. F. Lockwood. It is planned to attach this tablet to the boulder which Doctor Lockwood placed in front of the Dalebrook Apartments building in Brooktondale.
