citation: "13 Dec 1895. Digitally photographed entry in **Congregational Church 1868-1933 Minutes of meetings and Membership**, used with permission from Caroline Valley Community Church."
notes: >-

    - The date appears to be a later mis-transcription of George Wolcott's earlier entry, where the 6 could easily be mistaken for a 5. The official records showing 1896 as the date are further supported by the fact that in 1896, December 13th fell on a Sunday, in 1895 it fell on a Friday.
