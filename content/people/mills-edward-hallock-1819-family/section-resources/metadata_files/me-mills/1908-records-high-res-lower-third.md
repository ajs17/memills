    Notes:
        - There is a reference to paying for splitting wood 19 Feb, which was quite likely done by George Jansen. Jansen's notebooks do cover this time period, but at that point, his notes were brief and sporadic, mainly noting weather and deaths and not going into the details of his life as later notebooks do.
