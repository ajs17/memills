    Notes:

    - This page is the inside back cover of volume 41 of the Mills store sales journals show the store's businesses expenses in the final days of E. H. Mills and the transition after Edward's death to M. E. Mills. These books are hardcover, cloth.

    - While typical sales are entered in the books as you would expect, the family account records start in the back and are filled in toward the front.

    - The 22 Jan 1908 entry mentions Emily Hunting, who I believe may be a reference to Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924), Emily's neice, whose mother was also named Mary, and so Emily's neice may have been called by her full middle name, "Emily Huntting" by family to distinguish her from her mother, just as had been done with Emily. If this is Emily's neice, it is the only evidence of which I am aware that the Mills in Brookton kept in active contact with family in Long Island.

    - I have considered the possibility that in the 21 Jan 1908 entry, the name "Woodworth" could be a misspelling of "Woodruff" and a reference to Reverend Emily C. Woodruff, who was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church from 1899 to 1903, according to the **150th Anniversary Handbook** of Caroline Valley Community Church published 16 Sep 2018. A possible explanation could be that the Reverend had a special relationship with the Mills, and it would explain the reimbursement if she had been called upon to officiate the funeral. In support of this theory is the fact that the Reverend was with the Congregation for longer than most, and in the time between her departure and Edward's death, there had been several "supply" pastors with brief tenures, so Hannah and Emily may have preferred her to officiate the funeral. However, in addition to explaining the possibility of Emily misspelling the name of someone meaningful to her family, we would have to explain why this person was referenced as "Mrs." and not "Rev." (and it is perhaps not conclusively clear that it is "Mrs." and not "Mr." that was written in the first place), and the generic "att." seems an inadequate description if that theory were correct. Perhaps the most likely explanation is that this is an out-of-town acquaitance and Emily is reimbursing her travel costs, or some other mundane explanation. (Yet, contrast the formality of "Mrs. Woodworth" compared to the familiarity of the 22 Jan 1908 entry "Emily Huntting" suggesting this was indeed reimbursement for a service of some kind.) As yet, I don't have better theory as to the identity of this person, and it seems unlikely I ever will, unless I find this name referenced somewhere else, perhaps upon further investigation of the Good Templars minutes of the Jansen notebooks. 
  
    - The 23 Jan 1908 entry is presumably a reference to Ellen Gould.
