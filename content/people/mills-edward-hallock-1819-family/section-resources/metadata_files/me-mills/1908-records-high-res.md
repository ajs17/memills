    Notes:

    - This page is the inside back cover of volume 41 of the Mills store sales journals show the store's businesses expenses in the final days of E. H. Mills and the transition after Edward's death to M. E. Mills. These books are hardcover, cloth.

    - While typical sales are entered in the books as you would expect, the family account records start in the back and are filled in toward the front.

    - The 22 Jan 1908 entry mentions Emily Hunting, who I believe may be a reference to Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924), Emily's neice, whose mother was also named Mary, and so Emily's neice may have been called by her full middle name, "Emily Huntting" by family to distinguish her from her mother, just as had been done with Emily. If this is Emily's neice, it is the only evidence of which I am aware that the Mills in Brookton kept in active contact with family in Long Island.

    - The 21 Jan 1908 entry would seem to be referring to services provided by the "Rev. Woodworth" mentioned in Edward's obituary in the historical records of Caroline Valley Community Church. Further research into those historical records is needed, as the **150th Anniversary Handbook** of Caroline Valley Community Church published 16 Sep 2018 does not list a Rev. Woodworth as pastor at that time. I have considered the possibility that the name "Woodworth" could be a misspelling of "Woodruff" and a reference to Reverend Emily C. Woodruff, who was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church from 1899 to 1903, according to the **150th Anniversary Handbook**, but this is purely speculation. 1908 did appear to be a time of transition between pastors, so Reverend Woodruff may have returned briefly during that time, but then we have to explain why two people independently misspelled their long-time pastor's name the same way, and in the church records no less. This could also just be a "supply pastor". An examination of the church records will likely yield the answer, as they seemed to keep very good records on their pastors. 
  
    - The 23 Jan 1908 entry is presumably a reference to Ellen Gould.
