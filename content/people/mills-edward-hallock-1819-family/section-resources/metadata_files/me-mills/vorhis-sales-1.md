    This is a photo of a page from a general store sales journal, part of a series of such volumes that are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers. The dates span from the 1890's to the early 190X's. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills store location at the time of this writing. Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journsals, it was hoped that these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that would become Frank F. Mulks general store, and would later be known to the author as Brookton's Market. According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Vorhis owned the store from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it would become known as <strong>Frank F. Mulks</strong>, and it would seem that the prices used in the comparison in the calendar came from this source. I could not find anything identifying the store these journals were for, but my review was merely introductory and far from exhaustive. My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily's, although occassionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, perhaps even by someone who knows how to actually analyze handwriting, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to lean toward these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.

    In the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Willis Shurter is identified as the first man sitting on the left in a famous photo of Frank F. Mulks that is also used for the cover image of "Around Caroline" by Partricia A. Brhel, 2016.
