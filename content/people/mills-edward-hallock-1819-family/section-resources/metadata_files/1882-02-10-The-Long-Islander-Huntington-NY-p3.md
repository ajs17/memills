    - The relative time reference “Monday evening of last week” is 30 Jan in 1882, corroborating the genealogical records cited. 

    - Obviously, there is an entire line of vital information obscured, but I have done my best to fill in the data based on what we know from other sources. The most important detail is obviously the date of birth: “May” is clear, but the rest is open to interpretation. Fortunately, if we subtract “86 years, 8 months and 28 days” from 30 Jan 1882, we do arrive at precisely 02 May 1795, confirming the genealogical records cited.  
   
    - Note that this references prior publication of this notice in the Hempstead Sentinel, so there is some chance of finding more legible text. I have yet to locate issues of this paper from this time period.

—On Monday evening of last week one of the old residents of Hempstead died. Mr. Jonas D. Mills, who was born at Stony Brook, [unclear County?], May [unclear day and year], making him at the time of his death, 86 years, 8 months, and 28 days old. In his young days he learned the wheelwright trade, which at that time included the undertaking business. He subsequently took up farming in Queens County, but for the past 30 years he has not been actively engaged in business. He was married twice, and had two daughters and three sons, the latter still living—Edward H., J. Thomas, and Robert S. Mills. He came to this town about [unclear 1838?], locating at [unclear] (now Franklin) Square; in 1837 he came to this village, where he has ever since resided, with the exception of a few years. He always enjoyed good health, never needing a physician, and died of old age.

Mr. Mills was the father of J. Thomas Mills of Huntington.
