    It is interesting to note that the Brookton chapter of the W. C. T. U. was organized in 1907, the same year that Jessie Shurter and Emily Mills were baptized and officially joined the membership roll of Brookton Congregational Church. Here we see Emily listed as Superintendent of Literature and Publications. Many of her neighbors are listed beside her: Jessie Shurter (later Jessie Brewer) Mrs. Dr. B. F. Lockwood, Mrs. Daniel Mason and Anna Mulks.
