The mid-2000’s real estate listing indicated the home was built in 1865, although I can’t confirm that. As noted in the deed descriptions, the Mills' home was originally part of the Grist Mill property next door, what is presently Dalebrook Apartments. Over the years, the Grist Mill lot was subdivided several times.  

Several phrases from the Mills' home deeds are quoted in Molly Adams' "A Note on Emily Mills," including that the house was "part of the grist mill lot" and that it was "occupied by E. H. Mills as tenant."

A summary of the historical deeds referenced below, up to the time it was owned by Jesse Brewer:

[Charles W. Personius](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338759/charles-w-personius) (1840 to 1924) was a Union veteran of the Civil War, having enlisted and mustered in 25 Aug 1862, Middletown NY (other sources say Caroline NY) to Company G of the 50th Engineers Regiment with the rank of Private. He mustered out 13 Jun 1865, Fort Barry VA, under Colonel Pettes, with the rank of Sergeant, having been promoted twice. (New York: Report of the Adjutant-General 1893-1906, ancestry.com)

According to the website [The Civil War in the East](https://civilwarintheeast.com/us-regiments-batteries/new-york-regiments-and-batteries/artillery-and-engineers/50th-new-york-engineers/): "The 50th New York Infantry Regiment, which became the 50th New York Engineer Regiment, lost 1 officer and 19 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded and 1 officer and 206 enlisted men to disease during the Civil War. It is honored by a monument at Gettysburg shared with the 15th New York Engineers." The regiment organized as the 50th New York Infantry Regiment 18 Sep 1861 in Elmira NY and on 22 Oct 1861: "Detailed as sappers, miners and pontooners, and designated 50th New York Engineers at Washington, D.C. Attached to Woodbury’s Brigade, Army of the Potomac for duty at Alexandria, Va." The regiment participated in many of the pivotal events of the civil war, including the Maryland and Chancellorsville campaigns, as well as the battles fought at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. The regiment also witnessed the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox Court House 09 Apr 1865.

From the Engineer Brigade monument on the Gettysburg battlefield: "Engaged in arduous duties from June 13 to July 18 1863 bridging rivers and transporting pontoons to enable the Army to cross the Potomac River and its tributaries into Pennsylvania and to recross into Virginia." The following year: "To expedite the transportation of wounded three Companies made a forced march to Fredericksburg, starting at 11:30 a.m. Built bridge over the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg Lower Crossing, having it completed and ready for use at 4:30 p.m., having marched 8 miles and built bridge 420 feet long in 5 hours." 

The Grand Army of the Republic was created "in pursuance of Section 3 of Chap. 706 of the laws of 1887, New York State; [an] Act to provide for the relief of indigent soldiers, sailors and marines and the families of those deceased passed June 25, 1887." There were two G. A. R. posts in the Town of Caroline; the Henry Wilson Post #68 in Slaterville Springs, and the David Ireland Post #158 in Brookton.

The Brookton G.A.R. post filed a "notice of intent" on 29 Aug 1887. The officers named in that document were: John W. Gass--Commander, Spencer H. Jansen--Senior Vice-Commander, Sol. (Soloman) Honniss--Jr. Vice Commander, Charles Personius--Quarter Master, Edward Lounsbery-- Chaplain, John Hoover--Surgeon, Samuel Whited--Officer of the day, Willis Shurter--Adjutant, Don C. Hanford--"Sergent" Major, Moses Roe-- Officer of the guard, and the Relief Committee: Edward Lounsbery, Samuel Woodhull, Charles Personius. Later records indicate that other members were: George Wolcott, Fenton Huson, William Wolcott, Fred E. Bates, Leroy Gleason, Moses Hurlburt, John J. Roe, Calvin Deputron, Bennett Landon, Dennis Mullachy, and W. P. Richards.

On 6 Nov 1896, the Slaterville Springs G. A. R. Post filed with Town Clerk, B. Van Demark, a "notice of intent" showing the officers of that post. They were: Commander--Emanuel Davis, Senior Vice-Commander--John E. Bull, Junior Vice-Commander--George Barns (or Barnes), Chaplain--Preston Darling, Quarter Master--Isaac Lynch, Adjutant--Henry D. Lock (or Locke), and the Rifle Company consisting of: Leonard Griffon (or Griffen or Griffin), Preston Darling, and Isaac 122 Lynch. Later records indicate that other members who held positions were: George E. Harris, Joel Percell (or Purcell), John Personius, John Randall, John Huslander, Henry S. Krum, David B. Hammond, George Matson.

The last recorded reports from the posts were on 31 October 1899. In that time period, the "Notice of Intents" that were filed show that Post #158, (Brookton) paid $284.07 for the care and maintenance of veterans and their families and they asked the Town Board for $150.00. Post #68 (Slaterville Springs) paid $168.98. Some of the items that were provided were: board, fuel, clothing, food & tobacco, Doctor and nursing care, transportation to the Veterans Home in Bath, and burials. In February 1912, the David Ireland Post #158 was charged with payment to Fred Warriner for $7.00 worth of goods, and paid.

<blockquote>
When the Brooktondale Fire Company celebrated its first twenty years in 1966, residents were smug about progress since the war. The village had a fire company, natural gas, cable television, consolidated schools, a community center, telephones with direct dialing (no toll to Ithaca!), and now was looking forward to getting a safer road for school buses. From 1962 to 1967, Route 330 through Brooktondale was upgraded, for the first time since 1914. The improvements were greater than anyone expected. The Route 79 intersection was totally changed, and the entire road from there to 76 Road was “modernized.” Whole avenues of maples were lost; the abandoned upper mill was subjected to a spectacular “practice burn” in the summer of 1964; the bridge in front of the store was reconfigured. The old Shurter House, which had survived several floods in its day, was bought for one dollar and moved to its present location at 447 Brooktondale Road. Those who objected to the “Rape of Valley Road” complained that the road went nowhere, because it ended at 76 Road.

The first owner of the parcel that would become the Mills' home appears to be [William Benton Wolcott](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100303590/william-benton-wolcott) (06 Oct 1832 to 25 Feb 1911), the son of George and Sarah Wolcott. The historical deeds for Dalebrook refer to the adjoining property as the "Wolcott lot". William lists himself as a carpenter and a painter in the census data, and he was a Civil War veteran in the 137th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. After the untimely death of William's son Willis, William's wife raised her three young grandsons. One of those sons, Earl A. Wolcott died in combat in World War One, the "first Tompkins County boy to give his live in actual fighting against the Germans", dying in a French hospital on May 13, 1917 after being "seriously burned by a gas shell".

{{% fig "mills-home/car-deeds-5-138" "800" /%}}

Starting with Cameron Vorhis, andhhh [Frank Cameron Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/100452322/frank-cameron-vorhis) (1861 to 18 May 1919). Frank owned the old grist mill on the site of Dalebrook Apartments, and according to his obituary, "Mr. Vorhis had been in the milling business at Brookton for 32 years." (19 May 1919, The Ithaca Journal, Ithaca NY, p7.) 

According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Frank also owned the general store at that location from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. Frank Vorhis is the father of [Charlotte Esther (Vorhis) Pancoe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162242537/charlotte-esther-pancoe) (02 Aug 1893 to 19 May 1964) who was [baptized]({{% ref "baptism" %}}) with Emily and Jessie Brewer and is often referred to as "Miss Esther Vorhis" during that time. 


Frank's son [Charles Vorhis](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/162243893/charles-vorhis) (1913 to 1973) eventually bought the Mill's store building and moved the post office to that location in 1961, according to Molly Adams' "A Note on Emily Mills."

Aside from the members of the Mills family, the following people are mentioned in the deeds:

- [DeWitt F. Roe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/51355047/dewitt-f-roe) (04 Apr 1853 to 08 Mar 1918)
- [Edward Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338793/edward-lounsbery) (11 Oct 1833 to 27 Nov 1904) Edward and his wife Amanda (below) are among the original, charter members of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners. Edward died within the church while addressing the Christian Endeavor Society "about 7 o'clock" in the evening. "Death, however, had come instantaneously and was caused by apoplexy brought on it is thought by the mental effort he exerted in addressing the meeting." (28 Nov 1904, Ithaca Daily Journal, p6.) Church records show that Edward was one of the original organizers and members of the Congregational Church, present at the "informal meeting" on 05 Mar 1868 at the home of Walker V. Personius that resulted in the official organization of the Congregational Church of Mott's Corners on 12 Mar 1868, when Edward and Amanda are listed as charter members. It is noted in the Church's meeting minutes that at the 05 Mar meeting "on motion of Edward Lounsbery Mr. William Personius was chosen chairman and Walker V. Personius secretary." 
- [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921) Amanda was clerk in the church for many years, including after Edward's death and many entries in the church records are written by her hand. Edward and Amanda also owned the Mills' Store building for many years.
- [Fred D. Gilbert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/183607645/fred-d-gilbert) (24 Apr 1873 to 14 Nov 1941) Fred Gilbert was a prominent Ithaca businessman, working in this capacity as Emily's undertaker. His obituary states that he spent his boyhood in Brookton because his father, Rev. Herbert (middle initial either B. or C.) Gilbert, was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church 1872-1873. (*History of the Congregational Church, Brooktondale, New York.* Compiled and edited by Mrs. Amy Atwater on the occasion of The Centennial Celebration of the Caroline Valley Federated Church, Brooktondale, New York, June 16th, 1968.) Fred took a lifelong interest in his boyhood home, as evidenced for example, by his contribution to the Lockwood Memorial described elsewhere in this material. Fred was also known as an owner of light harness horses and as an organizer of the Tompkins County Fair.

In the deeds following Emily’s death, the first three names of possible heirs listed are Emily's cousins, the children of [James Thomas Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills), Edward's younger brother:
  - Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942) Sometimes spelled as Alonso.
  - George E. Mills (Feb 1856 to ?)
  - [Clarissa H. Etsell (Jun 1852 to Jan 1846)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell) (misspelled as "Etsall" on the deeds.)

[Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith) is another cousin of Emily's, the daughter of Edward's sister, Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting.

## Related Research

The Mills' home is the only real estate that I can find official documentation for the Mills' owning. Mills' store was at different times owned by Edward and Amanda Lounsbery, Amanda's sister Libbie Peck, and then Dr. Lockwood. 

Yet in the sales journals of [E. H. Mills]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}) general store in Brookton, the inside front cover of volume 41 seems to indicate the family purchased a barn on 23 Sep 1907 and rented it to John Roe for $0.50 a month starting in 1908:

{{% fig "me-mills/1907-09-23-barn-rent" "800" /%}}

I have not found a deed that corresponds to this date in the deed indexes for Caroline or Danby that are preserved by the Tompkins County Clerk. Interestingly, there is a real estate transaction between Amanda Lounsbery and John Roe earlier in 1907, that is perhaps related to the barn rental: 

{{% fig "mills-home/deeds-164-253-lounsbery-roe" "800" /%}}

There is only one other deed unrelated to the Mills’ home that I found associated with the Mills’ family, and it was a transaction that Emily helped facilitate between Willis Shurter and his wife Betsey:

Notice that these deeds include an affidavit from Dr. Lockwood.
