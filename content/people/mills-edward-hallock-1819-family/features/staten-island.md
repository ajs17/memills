---

It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850's, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be "of Factoryville". All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of [Bartlett Brown (1833 to 24 Nov 1902)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of [Charles Mills Pine (1812 to 8 Oct 1897)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine), who may have been related to Edward through Edward's mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, but it's likely that Charles acted only as an investor, and perhaps also an adviser, in the business and was not involved in its day-to-day operation.

In the 1875 New York State Census, each of the children are listed with Staten Island as their birthplace (years 1852, 1854 and 1858), and they were still living in Staten Island in 1860 as reflected in the Federal Census:

The 1860 census indicates the town is Castleton. Castleton is the name of one of the original four towns of Staten Island and Factoryville was the colloquial name at the time of one its neighborhoods, West New Brighton.

The 1860 census also shows that Edward and his family are living with Bartlett Brown, and according to the following tax assessment, Bartlett also lists Factoryville in the "Residence" column.

Barlett Brown was a protege of Charles Pine, both in the grocery business, and later, succeeding Charles as President of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Company:

Mr. Brown was born at Oak Farm, Long Island, and was one of ten children. His parents were among the most intelligent and estimable people of that section, and he was trained to many kinds of usefulness on the farm from a very early age. Indeed, the experiences which then came to him were invaluable, and fitted him in a superior degree for the diligent, manly and honorable life which succeeded.

He began business for himself as a coal and wood merchant in the city of Brooklyn, but later, in the year 1857, he accepted a position in the grocery store of Charles M. Pine at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleon avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family. He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.

He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home. Beside the store he had a profitable cranberry business at Calverton, L.I., which he sold to a brother two years ago.

According to data provided by the [Empire State Postal History Society](https://www.esphs.org/), Charles Pine was also postmaster of what was then called the North Shore, Staten Island post office from 16 Dec 1850 to 26 Oct 1853. This post office became the West New Brighton station of Staten Island on 21 Jan 1917. (It may also be of interest that the 1860 Census shows that there is a Betsey Mott born about 1807 living with Charles M. Pine.) 

A partial timeline of events in Staten Island while the Mills lived there:

The early 1860’s were a time of significant life changes for the Mills family and Bartlett Brown. The Mills moved to Corfu sometime between the Summer of 1862 and the Spring of 1863, during a period in which the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg MD was fought just a few hundred miles southwest of Castleton, and just before the draft riots on Staten Island. Also during the early 1860’s, Bartlett Brown started a new grocery store, married, and started a family of his own, as indicated by the 1865 census:

{{% fig "staten-island/census-1865-nys-brown" /%}}

As already mentioned, Charles M. Pine was listed as co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu:

{{% fig "corfu/1869-Gazetteer-Business-Directory-Genesee-County-inset" "400" /%}}

Further investigation is needed, but an obvious concrete question to explore is whether or not Charles M. Pine is related to Edward's wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine. Charles Pine married Almira (sometimes spelled "Elmira", although "Almira" appears to be correct) Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York: 

{{% fig "staten-island/1835-02-21-charles-pine" "700" /%}}

Charles lists himself as a merchant in Castleton in the 1850 Federal census, and James M. Hillyer lives with the Pine family, as a clerk in Charles' store. 


This Staten Island Directory from 1886 still lists Barlett Brown’s store:
