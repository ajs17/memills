It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850's, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be "of Factoryville". All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward works as clerk in the grocery store of Bartlett Brown and at one time, the Mills family lives with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of Charles M. Pine, who may have been related to Edward through Edward's mother.

In the 1875 New York State Census, each of the children are listed with Staten Island as their birthplace (years 1852, 1854 and 1858), and they were still living in Staten Island in 1860 as reflected in the Federal Census:

By 1863, the family was in Corfu, as evidenced by Edward's Civil War Draft Registration record from 1863 in Genesee County:

The 1860 census indicates the town is Castleton. Castleton is the name of one of the original four towns of Staten Island and Factoryville was the colloquial name at the time of one its neighborhoods, West New Brighton. As already mentioned, Edward's marriage announcement says he is "of Factoryville". The 1860 census also shows that Edward and his family are living with Bartlett Brown, and according to this tax assessment, he also lists Factoryville in the "Residence" column.

Mr. Brown was born at Oak Farm, Long Island, and was one of ten children. His parent were among the most intelligent and estimable people of that section, and he was trained to many kinds of usefulness on the farm from a very early age. Indeed, the experiences which then came to him were invaluable, and fitted him in a superior degree for the diligent, manly and honorable life which succeeded.

He began business for himself as a coal and wood merchant in the city of Brooklyn, but later, in the year 1857, he accepted a position in the grocery store of **Charles M. Pine** at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleon avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family. He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.

He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home. Beside the store he had a profitable cranberry business at Calverton, L.I., which he sold to a brother two years ago.

Further investigation is needed, but an obvious concrete question to explore is whether or not Charles M. Pine is related to Edward's wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine. There is a Charles Pine that married Almira (possibly a misspelling of "Elmira", or perhaps misspelled this way elsewhere, be sure to search for both) Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York, and elsewhere, his middle name appears to be Mills:
