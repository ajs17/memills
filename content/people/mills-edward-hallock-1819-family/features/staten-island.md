---

It appears the Mills lived in Staten Island throughout much of the 1850's, and Edward may have lived there for a significant time prior. When the Mills married in 1851, Edward is said to be "of Factoryville". All three Mills children were born in Staten Island. Edward worked as clerk in the grocery store of [Bartlett Brown (1833-24 Nov 1902)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199802084/bartlett-brown) and at one time, the Mills family lived with Bartlett. Bartlett was a protege of [Charles M. Pine (1812-8 Oct 1897)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/199952123/charles-m-pine), who may have been related to Edward through Edward's mother. Charles Pine is listed as a co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, and it would appear that Charles likely acted only as an investor in the business and was not likely to be involved in its day-to-day operation.

In the 1875 New York State Census, each of the children are listed with Staten Island as their birthplace (years 1852, 1854 and 1858), and they were still living in Staten Island in 1860 as reflected in the Federal Census:

It may be of interest that the 1860 Census shows that there is a Betsey Mott born about 1807 living with Charles M. Pine.

According to data provided by the [Empire State Postal History Society](https://www.esphs.org/), Charles was postmaster of what was then called the North Shore, Staten Island postoffice from 16 Dec 1850 to 26 Oct 1853. This postoffice would become the West New Brighton station of Staten Island on 21 Jan 1917.

By 1863, the family was in Corfu, as evidenced by Edward's Civil War Draft Registration record from 1863 in Genesee County:

The 1860 census indicates the town is Castleton. Castleton is the name of one of the original four towns of Staten Island and Factoryville was the colloquial name at the time of one its neighborhoods, West New Brighton. The 1860 census also shows that Edward and his family are living with Bartlett Brown, and according to the following tax assessment, Bartlett also lists Factoryville in the "Residence" column.

Bartlett Brown’s obituary
So, the years around 1860 were a time of change for Bartlett and the Mills family. The Mills would soon leave for Corfu and Bartlett started a new grocery store, married, and started a family of his own, as indicated by the 1865 census:

Barlett Brown was a protege of Charles M. Pine, both in the grocery business, and later, succeeding Charles as President of the Richmond County Mutual Insurance Company:

Mr. Brown was born at Oak Farm, Long Island, and was one of ten children. His parents were among the most intelligent and estimable people of that section, and he was trained to many kinds of usefulness on the farm from a very early age. Indeed, the experiences which then came to him were invaluable, and fitted him in a superior degree for the diligent, manly and honorable life which succeeded.

He began business for himself as a coal and wood merchant in the city of Brooklyn, but later, in the year 1857, he accepted a position in the grocery store of Charles M. Pine at West Brighton, and remained there, highly esteemed by the proprietor and by the many customers, until the year 1859, when he purchased the valuable property at the corner of Broadway and Castleon avenue and began business in the same line for himself. He resided in the adjoining house with his family. He was a man of the very strictest integrity in all of his affairs, and with the merchants of the city with whom he dealt, and with the other people with whom he had financial relations, he was held in the highest regard. In 1892 he retired from active life.

He set a fine example with regard to everything in which he was engaged during the forty-seven years when he made Staten Island his home. Beside the store he had a profitable cranberry business at Calverton, L.I., which he sold to a brother two years ago.

As already mentioned, Charles M. Pine was listed as co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu:

Further investigation is needed, but an obvious concrete question to explore is whether or not Charles M. Pine is related to Edward's wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine. It appears this is the same Charles Pine that married Almira (possibly a misspelling of "Elmira", or perhaps misspelled that way elsewhere, be sure to search for both) Jane Loper in 1835 in South Hempstead, New York:
