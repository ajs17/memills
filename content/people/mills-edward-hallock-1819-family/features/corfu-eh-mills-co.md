In his draft registration, Edward's occupation is listed as "merchant" indicating that he began E. H. Mills & Co. several years before the 1866 given by Allan Starkweather, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store:

<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

E. H. Mills & Co. was also referred to, on the maps at least, as "Mills Cash Store" or just simply "Cash Store."
