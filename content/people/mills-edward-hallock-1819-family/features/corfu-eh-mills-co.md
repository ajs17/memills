The family moves to Corfu NY in the early 1860's where Edward, along with partners Charles Pine and James Hillyer, starts E. H. Mills & Co. "cash store" offering general merchandise and dry goods. Horace clerks in the store for his father, and eventually commits suicide. Mary Ann is a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.

The Mills, including Emily at just over one year old, are included in the 19 June 1860 Federal Census in Staten Island:

Documentation suggests the Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 01 Sept 1862 and 01 May 1863, dates that correspond with tax assessment records of the time:

<div class="cols">
{{% mefig "tax-assessments/1862-09-01-District-29-Division-12" "300" /%}}
{{% mefig "tax-assessments/1863-05-01-District-29-Division-12" "300" /%}}
</div>
<div class="cols">

</div>
{{% mefig "tax-assessments/1865-05-01-District-29-Division-12" "700" /%}}
</div>

The tax assessments are divided by "districts" then further subdivided into "divisions" at which point, individuals and businesses are listed together alphabetically. Beginning with entries recorded 01 May 1863, for district 29, division 12, and each year thereafter, there are two entries for E. H. Mills & Co. and Edward H. Mills. The 1862 document shown, recorded on 01 Sep 1862, has no such entries where they would be expected. Of course, these are just record dates, but they do give us a better defined window for when the family moved. This time period overlaps Emily's fourth birthday as well as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, five days after the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate invasion of Maryland that took place just 200 miles from Castleton. However, even if we are interpreting the meaning of these documents correctly, it could still very well be that the family moved as early as the Summer of 1862. 

There is also a June 1863 Civil War Draft Registration record in Genesee County for Edward where his occupation was listed as "merchant":

As can be seen in the 1863 tax assessment documents, the Mills store is entered as "Mills E. H. & Co.", showing that it was already operating by 01 May 1863, several years before the 1866 date given by Allan Starkweather in the following account, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store, which he generously provided to me in what follows:

<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

I believe it highly likely James *M.* Hillyer is an error, albeit, one that is repeated, but this is the only record I have of a James *M.* Hillyer in Corfu or Staten Island. I believe this is actually James *A.* Hillyer, who is another dry goods grocer in Staten Island closely associated in business with Charles Pine for many years.

The fact that James Hillyer was a subscriber to the directory somewhat weakens my theory that this is a mistake, but I still think that this is the more likely explanation, but far from proven.

From the documents available to me, that include city directories and census data, I see no evidence that James Hillyer or Charles Pine ever lived in Corfu, and instead multiple sources in the 1860's and 1870's tie them only to Castleton, and I get the sense that they were probably more in the role of investors and possibly advisors and likely not involved in the day-to-day operations of the store.  For more information on Charles Pine and James Hillyer, see [The Mills Family in Staten Island]({{% ref "staten-island" %}}).

The following map images and associated business directories show both the E. H. Mills & Co. general store as well as the Mills' home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876. E. H. Mills & Co. was also referred to, on these maps and directories at least, as "Mills Cash Store" or just simply "Cash Store."

By 1876, the year that Horace died, Corfu had grown, but E. H. Mills & Co. and the Mills' home are still there:

A fire in 1899 destroyed the building that had once housed E. H. Mills & Co.:

Allan confirms the Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists.

According Edward and Mary Ann's obituaries in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church, the Mills moved to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879.

Their records also include confirmation that Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Cofu:

Emily would return to Corfu several times throughout her life.

## The MacGregors

The MacGregors moved to Corfu near the same time as the Mills family, the maps indicate that they lived across the street from the Mills home in Corfu, and attended the Presbyterian Church with Mary Ann.

## Churches in Corfu 

We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:

<blockquote>
The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:

<figure class="quote-only">
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4>

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 

I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.
