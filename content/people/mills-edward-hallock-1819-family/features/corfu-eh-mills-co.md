The family moved to Corfu NY in the early 1860's where Edward would start E. H. Mills & Co. general merchandise and dry goods with Charles Pine as one of his partners. Horace would clerk in the store for his father, and eventually commit suicide. Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.

The Mills family moved from Staten Island to Corfu sometime between 19 June 1860 when the Federal Census was taken in Staten Island and June 1863 when Edward's Civil War Draft Registration was recorded in Genesee County:

In his draft registration, Edward's occupation is listed as "merchant" indicating that he may have started E. H. Mills & Co. several years before the 1866 date given by Allan Starkweather, which was likely simply based on what he knew to be the earliest confirmed records of the store, which he generously provided to me in what follows:

<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

E. H. Mills & Co. was also referred to, on the maps at least, as "Mills Cash Store" or just simply "Cash Store."

The following map images and associated business directory show both the E. H. Mills & Co. general store as well as the Mills' home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876:

By 1876, the year that Horace died, Corfu had grown, but E. H. Mills & Co. and the Mills' home are still there:

A fire in 1899 destroyed the building that had once housed E. H. Mills & Co.:

Allan confirms the Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists.

According Edward and Mary Ann's obituaries in the records of Caroline Valley Community Church, the Mills moved to Mott's Corners in Mar 1879.

Their records also include confirmation that Mary Ann was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Cofu:

## Churches in Corfu 

We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:

<figure class="quote-only">
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Congregationalist Church</h4>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h4>Presbyterian Church</h4

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 

I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.
