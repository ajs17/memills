## Genealogy

Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown on Long Island and to this day the [Mills Pond District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)) is named for them:

 <figure class="quote-only">
 <blockquote>
It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.

In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council's website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.

 The original [Mills Pond House](https://www.millspondgallery.org/history-of-mills-pond-house) that Timothy built still exists today "to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages."

Edward H. Mills has partial entries on at least two Mills family genealogies:
  1. *Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York* at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, an archived version exists, and I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. This genealogy is dated 07 Aug 2003.
  2. *A Documentary history of the family of Mills : descended from George Mills of Hempstead and Jamaica* (ancestry.com. North America, Family Histories, 1500-1500 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2016.) This genealogy is dated 01 May 1939:

What follows is based initially on the data from the archived version of MillsAncestry.org with supplemental or contradictory information from the second source in brackets, beginning with Edward's parents, and further supplementing with what we think we know of Edward's family.

<blockquote class="quote-only">

<span>583.</span> [Jonas Davis Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138421270/jonas-d.-mills) (George , Isaac , Isaac , Timothy , Jonathan , George ) was born on 2 May 1795. He died on 30 Jan 1882.

Several of the marriages above and below are referenced, if not corroborated, in the volume *Early marriage records of the Mills family in the United States : official and authoritative records of Mills marriages in the original states and colonies from 1628 to 1865* published in 1916 by William Montgomery Clemens, accessed via ancestry.com:

As you can see, there is yet another Pine mentioned.

{{% mefig "long-island/1882-02-06-The-New-York-Times-p8" "400" /%}}

And to these genealogies, we can add Edward's branch to its ultimate conclusion:

<span>1030.</span> **Edward Hallock Mills** (born Smithtown NY, 25 Mar 1819, died Brookton NY, 01 Jan 1908).

Edward married (1) **Mary Ann (Pine) Mills** (born Hempstead NY, 08 Feb 1819, died Brookton NY, 28 Dec 1895). Married on 29 Dec 1850. 

Children:
  - **Jonas E. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1852, died Brookton NY, 14 Oct 1885).
  - **Horace F. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1854, died Corfu NY, 27 Oct 1876).
  - **Mary Emily Mills** who went by "Emily" and often signed her name as "M. Emily Mills" (born Staten Island NY, Dec 1858, died Brooktondale NY, 03 Nov 1937).
  
None of Edward's children married or had children.

Edward married (2) **Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills** (born England, 21 May 1824, died Brookton NY, 12 Feb 1917). Married on 30 Dec 1896. 

  - No children.

Notes:
  - Emily's and Hannah's birthdates was well as the birth places for Hannah, Emily, Jonas and Horace are based on census entries.
  - Edward's parents were married while Edward was in utero (at least according to one of the dates given) and his older brother Thomas was already a toddler.
  - Jonas Davis Mills and Mary Platt Mills appear to be relatives, although I have followed this through to be sure. 
  - The only source of Horace's exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.
  - Edward's middle name Hallock was his Mother's maiden name. Although most typically spelled "Hallock" there are occasionally alternate spellings of this name in the Mills and Hallock genealogies, such as "Halliock" and "Hallioch". According to Hallockville Farm Museum board member and historian Richard Wines "Spelling was flexible back in the day. There were lots of variants on the Hallock name, and sometimes different descendants used different spellings." (personal correspondence, 21 Jul 2021)
  - It would appear that Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily would appear to get her name from Edward's sister who passed over decade before Emily was born. 

It should be noted that there are two significant errors in both Mills genealogies described above. **Edward's brother born on 13 Feb 1817 is James Thomas Mills (also written as J. Thomas Mills) NOT Thomas James Mills**. It also appears that the birth year given in his obituary is correct, as it is corroborated by census records: 1827 instead of 1817. And so, we can update his entry accordingly:

  - 1029 M i [James Thomas Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills) was born on 13 Feb 1827 in New York City. He died 22 Apr 1915 in Huntington NY. 

The confusion with the name may arise because it would seem, based on the obituary for his son Watts, that J. Thomas Mills may have commonly gone by Thomas, and in some census records, it does appear that his name is written at Thomas J.

</div>

Several of J. Thomas Mills' children died in infancy, and according to a history of Huntington Rural Cemetery on [longislandgenealogy.com](http://longislandgenealogy.com/HuntingtonRural.html) these children were *re-buried* there on 22 May 1857: "One of the oldest "rural cemeteries" in Suffolk County, Huntington Rural Cemetery was established in 1853, during the "Rural Cemetery" movement of pre-Civil War America. ...As with many "rural cemeteries" across the country, burials from older family or farm cemeteries were moved to Huntington Rural Cemetery over the decades. Thus you will find dates long before 1853, some back into the 18th century, among the burials in this cemetery."

There is also a census entry for a daughter Cora M. born Jan 1871. 

The first three names of possible heirs listed in the [Mills home deeds]({{% ref "mills-home-brooktondale" %}}) from the time of Emily's death are the children of J. Thomas Mills:
  - [Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942)]() Sometimes spelled as Alonso.
  - [George E. Mills]()
  - [Clarissa H. Etsell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell) (misspelled as "Etsall" on the deeds.)

The last name referenced in the list of possible heirs, Mary Huntting Smith, may be a reference to Emily's neice, or a descendent of Emily's neice:
  - Edwards's sister [Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting (1821–1849)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991494/emily-tabitha-huntting) married [John Smith Huntting (1817–1893)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991462/john-smith-huntting),
  - their child [Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith), named after their Grandmother, married [Henry Chatfield Smith (1843–1896)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792299/henry-chatfield-smith),
  - their child [Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24392636/mary-emily_huntting-cross), Emily's neice, married: James M. Cross.

Several documents pertaining to Emily Tabitha Mills' marriage were referenced above.

I believe that it is Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924) who appears to be referenced in the sales records of the [Mills store]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}) by her full middle name "Emily Huntting". She was killed in a strange accident with a bus in front of her home:
