Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown on Long Island and to this day the [Mills Pond District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)) is named for them.

The original Mills family home built by Timothy Mills still exists today "to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages." ([Mills Pond Gallery](https://www.millspondgallery.org/))

In an elegant old home on North Country Road in St. James, visitors can find the impressive art gallery of the Smithtown Township Arts Council. The structure, known as the Mills Pond House, holds the work of talented artists and also represents a piece of Smithtown history.

It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.

In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council's website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.

The original house that was built by Timothy Mills before 1700 was partially destroyed by a fire, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-book". William Wickham Mills, a descendant of Timothy, restored the damaged part of the house and built a three-story addition in 1838.

Smithtown historian Bradley Harris said William Wickham Mills was one of the richest men in Suffolk County. He was a farmer and also a prominent landlord owning a large amount of land in Smithtown's Landing area. William Wickham Mills also served as Town Supervisor of Smithtown from 1838 – 1841.

According to the arts council website, a noted New York City architect by the name of Calvin Pollard designed the Mills Pond House. An example of Grecian design, materials such as English glass, Connecticut stone and Santo Domingo mahogany were used contributing to its elegance.

Harris said, "It was the most magnificent house in Smithtown."

According to the scrap-book, in 1846 a daughter of William Wickham Mills married into Smithtown's Smith family. When he died in 1865, his grandson Dubois Smith inherited the home and land. It was later passed on to Dubois Smith's two daughters Josephine and Mildred Smith, who donated the house to the Town of Smithtown in 1976.

Soon after the donation of the home to the town, the Smithtown Township Arts Council has been using the Mills Pond House to exhibit the artwork of regional and national artists. The arts council also holds art classes and special events for residents of all ages.

Despite modern adaptations such as gallery lighting and handicap access, the structure has remained basically unchanged. Visitors to the home can still find formal porticoes and marble mantelpieces. 

The regal Mills Pond House provides the perfect location to expose Smithtown residents to art and also reminds us of a noted local family and our rich history.

Many photos of the Mills Pond House, both historic and contemporary, exist online and in collections such as the Library of Congress. As an historic building, there is also substantial documentation on the structure itself, including detailed information on renovations and restorations over the generations, that is publicly available. Just to the west of the Mills Pond House is the Mills Cemetery (also referred to as Mills Pond Cemetery and Mills Graveyard) where many of Emily's ancestors are buried. 

Edward H. Mills has partial entries on the following Mills family genealogies:
 
1. *Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York* at MillsAncestry.org. That site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, an archived version exists, and I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. This genealogy is dated 07 Aug 2003.

2. *A Documentary history of the family of Mills : descended from George Mills of Hempstead and Jamaica* (ancestry.com. North America, Family Histories, 1500-1500 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2016.) This genealogy is dated 01 May 1939:

What follows is based initially on the data from the archived version of MillsAncestry.org with supplemental or contradictory information from the second source in brackets, beginning with Edward's parents: 

<blockquote class="quote-only">

</blockquote>

Add to these genealogies, Edward's branch to its ultimate conclusion:

<span>1030.</span> **Edward Hallock Mills** (born Smithtown NY, 25 Mar 1819, died Brookton NY, 01 Jan 1908).

Edward married (1) **Mary Ann (Pine) Mills** (born Hempstead NY, 08 Feb 1819, died Brookton NY, 28 Dec 1895). Married on 29 Dec 1850. 

Children:
  - **Jonas E. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1852, died Brookton NY, 14 Oct 1885).
  - **Horace F. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1854, died Corfu NY, 27 Oct 1876).
  - **Mary Emily Mills** who went by "Emily" and often signed her name as "M. Emily Mills" (born Staten Island NY, Dec 1858, died Brooktondale NY, 03 Nov 1937).
  
None of Edward's children married or had children.

Edward married (2) **Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills** (born England, 21 May 1824, died Brookton NY, 12 Feb 1917). Married on 30 Dec 1896. 

  - No children.

Notes:
  - Emily's and Hannah's birthdates was well as the birth places for Hannah, Emily, Jonas and Horace are based on census entries.
  - Jonas Davis Mills and Mary Platt Mills may be related, although I have yet to follow up on this. 
  - The only source of Horace's exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.
  - Edward's middle name Hallock was his Mother's maiden name. Although most typically spelled "Hallock" there are occasionally alternate spellings of this name in the Mills and Hallock genealogies, such as "Halliock" and "Hallioch". According to Hallockville Farm Museum board member and historian Richard Wines "Spelling was flexible back in the day. There were lots of variants on the Hallock name, and sometimes different descendants used different spellings." (personal correspondence, 21 Jul 2021)
  - It appears Edward named his second son after his father, and Emily may get her middle name from Edward's sister who passed over decade before Emily was born. 

Several of the marriages above and below are referenced, if not corroborated, in the volume *Early marriage records of the Mills family in the United States : official and authoritative records of Mills marriages in the original states and colonies from 1628 to 1865* published in 1916 by William Montgomery Clemens, accessed via ancestry.com:

As you can see, there is yet another Pine mentioned. For more information on Charles Pine, see the account of the [Mills family in Staten Island]({{% ref "staten-island" %}}).

It should be noted that **Edward's brother born on 13 Feb 1827 is James Thomas Mills (also written as J. Thomas Mills) NOT Thomas James Mills**. The confusion with the name may arise because it seems, based on the obituary for his son Watts, that J. Thomas Mills may have commonly gone by Thomas, and in some census records, it does appear that his name is written as Thomas J.

1827 as James' birth year is corroborated by multiple sources, and would suggest that his birth had something to do with his mother's death a few weeks later. So, he was Edward's younger brother, not older. J. Thomas Mills' obituary suggests that either the family moved around a bit (see Jonas' obituary below), and/or perhaps Edward's purported birthplace is not Smithtown, but was assumed to be at some point. Also, the fact that the month of Jonas and Mary Hallock's marriage is disputed may be a clue of some kind, as December would mean that Edward was conceived before his parents were married, February would not. Such a revision of history under those circumstances is not unheard of. 

And so, the cited genealogical entries can be updated accordingly:

- M iii [James Thomas Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74905990/james-thomas-mills) was born on 13 Feb 1827 in New York City. He died 22 Apr 1915 in Huntington NY.

{{% fig "long-island/1915-04-23-The-Long-Islander-Huntington-NY-p5" "500" /%}}
</div>

Several of James' children died in infancy, and according to a history of Huntington Rural Cemetery on [longislandgenealogy.com](http://longislandgenealogy.com/HuntingtonRural.html) these children were *re-buried* there on 22 May 1857: "One of the oldest "rural cemeteries" in Suffolk County, Huntington Rural Cemetery was established in 1853, during the "Rural Cemetery" movement of pre-Civil War America. ...As with many "rural cemeteries" across the country, burials from older family or farm cemeteries were moved to Huntington Rural Cemetery over the decades. Thus you will find dates long before 1853, some back into the 18th century, among the burials in this cemetery."

There is also a census entry for a daughter Cora M. born Jan 1871. 

The first three names of possible heirs listed in the [Mills' home deeds]({{% ref "mills-home-brooktondale" %}}) from the time of Emily's death are the children of J. Thomas Mills:
  - Alonzo W. Mills (Jul 1858 to 09 May 1942) Sometimes spelled as Alonso.
  - George E. Mills (Feb 1856 to ?)
  - [Clarissa H. (Mills) Etsell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/74907705/clarissa-h.-etsell) (Jun 1852 to Jan 1946). (Her name is misspelled as "Etsall" on the deeds.)

At the time I am compiling this information, findagrave.com does not have entries for all the Mills in Huntington Rural Cemetery:

{{% fig "long-island/1853-1990-Index-To-The-Huntington-Rural-Cemetery" "800" /%}}

And the 1900 census is worth highlighting for the density of information it contains, including that J. Thomas and his sons George and Alonzo were all neighbors on Wall Street in Huntington:

{{% fig "long-island/1900-us-census-huntington-mills" "800" /%}}

The last name listed as a possible heir in the Mills' home deeds, Mary Huntting Smith, is likely a reference to Emily's cousin, or perhaps a descendent of Emily's cousin:
  - Edward's sister [Emily Tabitha (Mills) Huntting (1821–1849)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991494/emily-tabitha-huntting) married [John Smith Huntting (1817–1893)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23991462/john-smith-huntting),
  - their child [Mary Halliock (Huntting) Smith (1845–1938)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792330/mary-halliock-smith), named after their Grandmother, married [Henry Chatfield Smith (1843–1896)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24792299/henry-chatfield-smith),
  - their child [Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24392636/mary-emily_huntting-cross), married: James M. Cross.

Several documents pertaining to Emily Tabitha Mills' marriage were included above.

I believe that it is Mary Emily Huntting (Smith) Cross (1875-1924) who appears to be referenced in the sales records of the [Mills' store]({{% ref "me-mills" %}}) by her full middle name "Emily Huntting". She predeceased Emily Mills as the result of a strange accident with a bus in front of her home:
