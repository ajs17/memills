Upon moving to Mott's Corners, Edward restarted his general store, now simply *E. H, Mills*, on his own, with his son Jonas working as clerk. Emily would eventually also work as clerk in the store, taking it over upon Edward's death and operating it as *M. E. Mills* until her death in 1937.

It is really in Brookton where we get a sense of the family's finances through property deeds, reported estate information and the Mills store sales journals. The Mills family likely always made a fairly modest, if stable, income from their small general stores.

I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books that are in the possession of a local collector who told me that he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time that Frank took possession of the former Mills store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value. 

Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled "41" is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceeding Edward's death. It would seem that Emily herself did not preserve the books from her father's time running the store.

*M. E. Mills* is listed as a "present merchant" in The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village".

It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.

These records show us how Emily's store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920's, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward's entries decades before, these are more modern books that also tracked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had "specimen" pages to teach how to use the forms within.

We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are that Emily did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic.)

Identical notices for the Halloween party were run in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.

Two articles in the Jul 14, 1934 (page 3) and Nov 20, 1934 (page  5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch." Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendents of the accused.

## Notes for Future Researchers

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals that I believe belong to the general store of Frank C. Vorhis in the location of Brookton's Market today.

These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890's to the early 190X's.  I could not find anything identifying the store these journals were for, but my review was merely introductory and far from exhaustive. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills store location at the time of this writing. 

Given that Frank donated them, and that the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, it was hoped that these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location that would become Frank F. Mulks general store, and which would later be known to the author as Brookton's Market. According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Vorhis owned the store from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it would become known as <strong>Frank F. Mulks</strong>, and it would seem that the prices used in the comparisons in the calendar came from these sales journals. 

My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily's, although occassionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see that similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, perhaps even by someone who knows how to actually analyze handwriting, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to lean toward these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.
