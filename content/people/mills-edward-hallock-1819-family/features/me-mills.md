Upon moving to Mott's Corners, Edward restarted his general store on his own, now simply called E. H. Mills. Jonas clerked for his father, as did Emily, eventually taking over the store after Edward's death and operating it under the name M. E. Mills until her death in 1937.

This photo shows Mills' store as it looks presently, at 484 Brooktondale Road: .

Long-time community members call this building "the old post office" referring to when it was used as such after it was M. E. Mills and then Jesse Brewer's store. But the post office had also been in that building many years prior, moving there when Edward Mills became postmaster. It appears George Richardson was an employee of Edward's, as he is never identified as postmaster in the USPS records:

It seems likely the Mills' store was always in this building. The following are some of the earliest references to the Mills' store and they recount misadventures that took place at a time when Emily was identified as "clerk" in E. H. Mills:

It is really in Brookton where we get a sense of the family's finances through property deeds, reported estate information and the Mills' store sales journals. The Mills family likely always made a fairly modest, if stable, income from their general stores.

I have seen perhaps more than a dozen volumes of sales journals and other financial record books  are in the possession of a local collector who told me  he was contacted by Frank Proto at the time  Frank took possession of the former Mills' store building, and he was given the opportunity to go through the basement of the building and preserve anything of historical value. 

{{% fig "me-mills/vol-41-spine" "800" /%}}

Interestingly, the oldest of the volumes, labeled "No. 41" is the most important as it shows the records of E. H. Mills in the days immediately preceding Edward's death. It seems  Emily herself (or perhaps Jessie Brewer after her) did not preserve the books from her father's time running the store.

It appears  the "Mills Family a/c" pages are the Mills' business expenses, mostly paying for store inventory. In these earlier books, this information was at the end of the book, starting with the inside back cover and progressed toward the front over time, whereas retail sales, including what the family themselves took out of the store, were entered in the books in the normal order.

And the Mills Family account in the months following Edward's death: 

{{% fig "me-mills/1908-03-04-sales-journal" "800" /%}}

It is interesting to note  on the inside front cover of this book seems to indicate  the family purchased a barn on 23 Sep 1907 and rented it to John Roe for $0.50 a month:

The store was open on New Year's eve and New Year's day 1908, the day Edward died, and Emily was working on an otherwise typical day of business at the store:

As you can see, these books contain many easily recognizable names of former Brookton residents, along with a glimpse into their regular purchases. It is interesting to note  the store was closed on Sundays, but open on Christmas day, if a bit slow:

And some examples of Emily's own entries in the sales logs. Essentially, this is a glimpse inside Emily and Hannah's pantry. Emily may have had a bit of a sweet tooth, as candy was one of the more common staples:

By 1920, her daily records looked much the same. References are made to individual accounts

{{% fig "me-mills/1920-01-19-Sales-Journals-p233" "800" /%}}

In the 1920's, more sophisticated business records emerge, both new types of records kept as well as a more formal breakdown of the store's inventory expenditures. These journals contained sample pages and instructions for how to properly use them for bookkeeping  Emily may have used to teach herself these new methods. This is further indication of Emily's character and how much pride she took in ownership of her store  she was continually teaching herself new practices, even after decades of daily work in this occupation.

As Molly Adams wrote in her "Note", Emily begins aggressively advertising the newly branded store in 1909. She advertised perhaps dozens of times in the Ithaca Daily Journal alongside the Vorhis Mill and the meat market  is attributed to Clarence Wheeler, someone mentioned many times in the journals of George Jansen. The first such advertisement I could find was in the 29 Mar 1909 edition, and the last was on 30 Jun 1910. What follows are a sample of some of them, many of which were repeated for weeks at a time, and they give us a good sense of the diverse products offered in the small country store:

In The Ithaca Daily Journal, 26 Aug 1909, pg 5, in an article "Early History of Brookton Village" M. E. Mills is listed as a "present merchant".

Several descriptions of M. E. Mills exist, the most complete of which is Gertrude Conant's:

{{% fig "conant-gertrude-1" "800" /%}}

In one of the present-day photos of 484 Brooktondale Road, you can see the staircase on the side of building leading to the second floor,  Gertrude mentions.

“A Drive-by Tour of the Town of Caroline” sponsored by the Town of Caroline Bicentennial Committee 1994-1995 contains a listing for M. E. Mills on a page identified as “Tour 4 - P7” in a 2016 reprint by The White Church Cabin Country Store and is the source (with some alterations) of the description Molly Adams used in her “Note”. In Molly’s research notes, she gives the attribution: “[Driveby, ie Conant]" and I have confirmed with Barbara Kone  Gertrude wrote the Brooktondale portions of the "Drive-by" book:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
<strong>BROOKTONDALE POST OFFICE, left -- 484 Brooktondale Road</strong>

This was Miss Mary Emily Mills'(1861-1937) Dry Goods Store. She also had kerosene, Kerosene lamps with green shades, penny candy, stockings, handkerchiefs, yard goods, pins & sewing notions sheets & pillowcases, groceries, etc. She was a "sweet little lady" who succeeded her father in the business. Jessie Brewer had dry goods here after Miss Mills, and also had a lending library in the back.

The post office has moved at least 3 times. This is the 3rd site.Between the Post Office and the bridge sat the Shurter House which was moved.
</blockquote>

(I tried to faithfully reproduce the punctuation, capitalization, spacing, etc. of the source.)

And Molly Adams, in A Note on Emily Mills tells of Emily's initial marketing attempts on her own:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
Before David VanDeMark’s mother Grace died, he had found in her sewing machine (which had been acquired from Clara Lockwood) a little leatherette booklet labeled on the outside “M. E. MILLS, DEALER IN DRY GOODS, GROCERIES, HARDWARE AND CROCKERY, BROOKTON, N.Y.” On the inside is a calendar covering July 1909 to July 1910, a pack of needles and a fabric needle holder. The text says *This is a complete set of needles for all purposes. All the best imported. We would very much appreciate your patronage when anything in our line is needed.”
</blockquote>

We know a great deal about Emily through the activities of M. E. Mills, which Emily made a community focal point as a natural consequence of her many interests and activities, and intentional or not, had to have been excellent marketing for her store. (My impressions are  Emily took a great deal of pride in the running of her store and took its effective management very seriously and did indeed consider every opportunity to volunteer her store for free press and increased foot traffic, such as the regular millinery exhibits by Margaret LaBar.)

[Libbie H. (Sanders) Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138388479/libbie-h-peck) (05 Nov 1857 to 04 Nov 1929) took over ownership of the Mills' store building upon the death of her sister [Amanda (Sanders) Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338794/amanda-lounsbery) (12 Oct 1842 to 13 Nov 1921).

Two articles in the 14 Jul 1934 (p3) and 20 Nov 1934 (p5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch." Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendants of those accused.

Identical notices for the Halloween party were run in The Ithaca Journal on 28 Oct and 29 Oct 1935.

And in the following, Molly Adams seems to indicate "at the store" refers to what is presently known as Brookton's Market, owned by Robert (Bob) Tucker at  time, and not M. E. Mills, although her choice of words is noticeably vague on the point. Presumably, I can find the original quote and get a better sense of this, but its not obvious this isn't referring to Mills' store:

<blockquote class="quote-only">
...At Old Home Day in 1935 Professor Edwin Shurter proposed a memorial to Dr. Lockwood: those who wished to contribute could sign up "at the store." This store in the center of town, with the post office attached, had become, and remains, a village hub. ... Jessie Brewer sold dry goods and had a lending library where Emily Mills's store had been. 

*— Molly Adams, "Town of Caroline" in **The Towns of Tompkins County: From Podunk to the Magnetic Springs** edited by Jane Marsh Dieckmann, p63*
</blockquote>

{{% fig "1935-11-23-The-Ithaca-Journal-p5" "500x500" "" "top" /%}}

The memorial, presumably with the text provided by the professor, currently sits outside of Dalebrook Apartments, on the southwest corner of the former grist mill lot, directly across the street from the former location of the Mills' store, and facing the former Lockwood residence. There is also a bronze sundial on top of the stone (not visible in the photo)  appears to have been attached along with the tablet.

As noted in other histories, Jessie Brewer took over the store at the same location, running it under her name primarily as a notions store with a lending library in the back, and no groceries.

## Notes for Future Researchers

In the Caroline History Room in Slaterville Springs, there are a set of similar looking general store sales journals  I believe belong to the general store of Frank C. Vorhis in the location of Brookton's Market today.

<div class="cols">
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-1" "350" /%}}
{{% fig "me-mills/vorhis-sales-2" "350" /%}} 
</div>

These volumes are leather bound, but with badly deteriorating covers, containing entries from the 1890's to the early 190X's.  I could not find anything identifying the store these journals were for, but my review was merely introductory and far from exhaustive. A note accompanying them indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, owner of the Mills' store location at the time of this writing. 

Given  Frank donated them, and  the style of record keeping is quite similar to known Mills sales journals, it was hoped  these might be earlier books of E. H. Mills' general store. When asked for more information on their origin, Barbara Kone said they came from Frank's basement, and when pressed further for which basement, she said "from the Mill" meaning the basement of Dalebrook, also owned by Frank Proto at the time of this writing, and at the time of the sales journals in question, was owned by Frank C. Vorhis, who also owned a general store next door in the location  eventually became Frank F. Mulks general store, and presently, Brookton's Market. According to the Brookton's Market 2011 Calendar, Vorhis owned the store from the 1880's to its sale to the Mulks brothers in 1902, when it became known as Frank F. Mulks. That timeframe matches up with these journals, and it appears  the prices used in the comparisons in the calendar came from these books. 

My review led me to conclude there were possibly several different handwriting styles, and although I have not looked through the entries thoroughly, I spent a little time reviewing a random sampling of entries over several books and could not confidently identify any handwriting as Emily's, although occasionally I thought I might have seen an interesting similarity, I could not see  similarity consistently. Obviously a more careful examination should be done, perhaps even by someone who knows how to actually analyze handwriting, but in the meantime, the weight of the evidence seems to lean toward these being the sales journals of Vorhis' store.
