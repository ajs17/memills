It appears these portraits as well as other information on the Buffalo Mills that are in the Queens collection were transferred there from The Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo NY.

<blockquote>
<p>If I recall correctly, the photo of the house in Buffalo was the only thing we retained from the Mills family collection. Everything else, photos and papers, was transferred to Queens. 
<p>
</p>
However, we do have other loose photos of individuals in A-Z order by surname. I checked and these are the only people named Mills:
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> John H. Mills, Company D, appears to be a Civil War soldier portrait.</li>
  <li> Edward M. Mills, ca. 1915. He is a young man in this photo, so he is not the Edward Mills who died in 1908.</li>
  <li> Robert Mills, ca. 1880, as an elderly man.</li>
  </ul>

The photograph of a Mills home in Buffalo still in the possession of The Buffalo History Museum is of 111 Park Street:

The house at 111 Park Street turns out to have been the home of William & Deborah Mills. She lived in it as a widow until 1882, when the family sold it after her death.

[William Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770560/william-mills) (17 Nov 1792, Smithtown NY to 15 Aug 1867, Buffalo NY) who was married on 08 Jun 1819 to [Deborah (Smith) Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/78770568/deborah-mills) (02 Dec 1768, Smithtown NY to 13 Jun 1882, Clarence NY), is Jonas Davis Mills' cousin. These Mills and their descendants lived in Buffalo the entire time that Edward H. Mills' family was living in Corfu, approximately 30 miles away door-to-door. 

## Robert Mills

As far as I can tell, [Robert Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77507182/robert-mills) (17 Nov 1824 to 11 Dec 1890) is not related, at least not closely, to the descendants of Timothy Mills.
