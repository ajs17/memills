Evelyn, I am doing historical research on two women who lived in my home in the early 1900's: Ellen Gould (1848-1929) and Emily Mills (1861-1937), and I realize this is a long-shot, but I'm hoping you can help. If I am correct, Ellen Gould (who was Ellen Predmore by a previous marriage to William Predmore) was your late husband's great grandmother. (As I understand it, Ellen had a son Myron whose son Harold was Les' father?) I am interested in any biographical information you may have on Ellen and are willing to share, but in particular, I am interested in any photos you may have of her, and I am hopeful that a photo of Ellen may also show Emily, whether she is identified or not. I have been researching both women for a while now, and so far, there are no known photos of either.

Carol, I am doing historical research on someone who lived in my home in Brooktondale NY (then known as Brookton) in the early 1900's who I think may be your great great grandmother. She was known as Ellen Gould (1848-1929) at the time, but her first marriage was to William Predmore (1842-1884). (I can share with you the genealogy as I understand it, if you want.) I am curious to learn any biographical information you have on her, photos, whatever you may have and are willing to share. I am also curious to see if there are photos of her with another woman that she lived with at the time: Emily Mills. I have been researching both women for a while now and so far, there are no known photos of either. I realize its a long-shot, but in my desperation, I am reaching out to descendants of Ellen for help (Emily has no direct descendants). Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

Hi Adam. Yes, Ellen Andrews Predmore Gould is my great great grandmother. I will check but I don't think I have any pictures of Ellen. My mother was born in 1916 and had only two memories of Ellen. That she was very proper and spoke with an English accent. I have no information regarding Emily Mills. I would be glad to see your information regarding Ellen. I'll check with my cousin to see if they might know anything about Ellen. Their grandmother was named after Ellen. And I'll look back thru family photos to be sure there are no photos. Feel free to email me at Coggshallca@aol.com. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me. I'll let you know what I find. It may be a few weeks before I have any answers.


Thank you very much for checking! (I know its an exteme long-shot.) I don't know much about Ellen either, but I do have a documented personal recollection that she and Emily looked similar. (And Emily is described as a small woman with her hair in a bun, and it sounds like they had similar personalities.) I also think that Ellen may have come to live in the home to help care for Hannah Mills, Emily's elderly step-mother who had been widowed recently. It appears Ellen was active in the Baptist Church and may have lived with Emily for some years, possibly some time after Hannah's death in 1917, so it seems she may have lived here for roughly a decade or possibly more.(My address is 475 Brooktondale Road, Brooktondale, NY., although the home has been added onto over the years, so it won't looks very similar. If you want, I can email you the document I mentioned, which has a very small, grainy photo of the home and the street from the early 1900's. Most of what I know of her (and Emily) aside from genealogy, comes from the newspapers of the day and their neighborhood "gossip" sections! If I learn anything significant, I can certainly send it along to you (and in general, I need to organize what I have so far, its now much, but scattered bits of data in multiple places). It is interesting to hear that she had an English accent, as I thought I saw reference to her immigration, but I wasn't sure the identify matched. Do you know if her maiden name was Thather? So far I have only found one other set of Ellen's descendants and have been in contact with Evelyn Predmore in Willseyville whose late husband Les was (I think) a great grandson of Ellen. I also have a photo of Myron Predmore's farm if you are interested, which was next to the old train station in Brooktondale, and sadly, is now a gravel pit.

Hi Adam
 
I’ve reread your Facebook messages and email and I have a few thoughts.
 
First: How wonderful that you are interested in the history of your house. I’ll gladly give you any information I might have that can be of help to you. But, you have to agree to let me visit you the next time I’m in the area. My parent grew up in Groton and I have lots of family in the Ithaca, Cortland, Slaterville Springs and Eliss Hollow area. (although most of my visits are in cemeteries). I would love to meet Evelyn Predmore.
My dad’s grandparents owned a farm west of Groton. I visit the current owners every time I’m in the area. They have done wonders with the old farm house.
 
My GG Grandmother Ellen’s maiden name was Andrews. The name Thather does not appear in any of my genealogical records. My Dad was the genealogist in the family. So everything I have added is all based on his paper records. And he seldom researched the wives or husbands of direct line family members. To difficult when information was only obtained by writing letters and waiting for replies. And as you have probably already figured out census records are not always accurate.
 
I must apologize but I’m getting ready to leave on a trip. I’ll be back in 10 days and will have time to pull out all the old photo albums to look for pictures. And properly look at my records. But it appears that Ellen moved to Caroline/Brooktondale area only after William died. Perhaps to live with or near her daughter Ina who lived in Caroline or Myron who lived in Brooktondale.  It appears Alfred Gould, Ellen’s 2nd husband already lived in Caroline. And I do see based on census records Ellen lived as a servant with Emily Mills.
Don’t give up on me. I’ll be back in touch.
Thank you for reaching out to me.
P.S. How did you determine my relationship to Ellen? 


I'm thrilled you reached out to me. Usually I'm the one sending an email. I have a template made up. Hi______, you don't know me but Ancestry says we are ___th cousins. I see __________ on your tree. How are you related to them? Crazy, right??
Ellen Louesa Predmore Paetow is my Great Aunt. She was my grandfather Clarence Predmore's sister. Ellen passed away in 1983. And I do know that Ellen was named after her grandmother Ellen Andrews Predmore. She was a wonderful person. Ellen has 2 daughters and I have reached out to them to see if they have any information about Ellen Andrews. I don't expect that they will. Also I faintly remember Myron Predmore. Probably some pictures here of Myron and my grandparents. And maybe Ellen. 
Paul Predmore was one of Myron's sons. When Paul died he lived at 608 Valley Road, Brooktondale. 
Hope some of this helps. I look forward to hearing how your travels back in time turn out.

to me

Adam,
     I have done some research on the Mills family of Corfu.  I'm afraid I didn't find a lot of new info for you.
The only mention I have of Emily Mills is that she accompanied her father's body from Ithaca to Corfu when he died in 1908
to be buried in the Corfu cemetery.
    Horace Mills died on 10/27/1876, by a gunshot, when he committed suicide.  No other info was given.
    The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880.
The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.
    The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s.  It never had its own building.  It spent a few years
as part of the Presbyterian Church, then ceased to exist.
    One strange item was that their PO was listed as W. Batavia as Corfu and Pembroke had their own POs at this
time.
    That's all I have right now.  Hope it is of some help to you.  I will continue to research this.
                                                       Take care- Al Starkweather- Corfu Historian

Hello,

The Corfu Public Library has limited resources in the local history and genealogy section.  I searched for any mention of Horace Mills via the Richmond Library website but was unable to locate anything (https://www.batavialibrary.org/localhistory?qt-guide=2#qt-guide).  They have issues of local newspapers on microfilm but I am unsure what dates are available.  I attached the entry from Evergreen Hill Cemetery but I am thinking that the Historical Society already provided you with a copy.  Sorry to have not been of more assistance.  Good luck with your search.  Diana

Randolph Kinne opened a store on the northeast corner (where M&T Bank now stands); later called Ogden's Corners, as Alfred E. Ogden operated it from 1881. This building burned in Corfu's first large fire in 1899, and the lot sat vacant until the bank was built in 1927.

...

Corfu United Presbyterian Church
In 1817, the Rev. Hugh Wallis, a missionary under the Holland Land Company, found a religious society already established in the Pembroke township. He gathered together some more people and formed a congregation under the authority of the Presbyterian Church. As was the custom with Land Companies, four acres was granted for an established congregation to build a house of worship. The church sold the land in "London," now the Lover's Lane Road area) for $400 and used it towards the construction of a building at Longs Corners. The present sanctuary in Corfu was begun in 1829 and had a seating capacity of 100 persons. Over a spht in doctrine the church dissolved. The new church immediately arising was called the Presbyterian Church in North Pembroke. Because of the rough times during the Civil War not much is known of the church history between 1834-1870. Like most churches of the time it barely kept its head above water while the women supported the meeting house in the absence of men. They oftentimes went into debt-an elder holding a note for the church. He was repaid in time and gave the interest free. The largest debt contracted was $25 for the repair of pew cushions. It took the ladies five years to repay the note held by Elder Whittlesey. After the war a large revival was held. That and a large movement to the mid- west changed the church rolls drastically. In 1887 there was a large scale move towards discipline and inactive members were excommunicated. Several cases were tried before session. About this time session indicated the evils of Sunday newspapers to the congregation.

In 1910 the Methodist and Universalist Churches disbanded strengthening the Presbyterian congregation. The turn of the century was a time of prosperity. In 1903 Cyrus Carrier became clerk of the session. In 1953 he was honored for over 50 years of well-kept books. In 1928 Rev. William Easton was called to pastor the church. He held the distinction of the longest pastorate in the church's history — 15 years. Before that pastors continued their relationship with the church for an average of 3 or 4 years. Rev. Paul Hagen came as a supply minister in 1943 and was asked to' stay in 1944. In 1947 Dr. Bergen accepted the call to the ministry, at that time the attendance was 240 members. In 1955, when his ministry was ended with his death the membership was 240. Rev. Sheldon Dodds supplied and in 1957 Rev. George Fritting was called as pastor. He was followed by Rev. James Bower in 1963 and Rev. Richard Murdoch in 1967.Rev. Charles Alexander has served since 2003.

Hi Adam - 

Unfortunately, I have some bad news. I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 

I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again. 

Now if you have any names of the grandchildren, or even their grandchildren, that might be at least from the 1900s, I might be able to look to see if I can find information on them. 

I truly am sorry that I do not have more information for you.

1908 Deaths Continued
  Edward Hallioch[?] Mills Died Jan 1st 1908 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. He was born at Smithtown L.I. March 25, 1819 - lacking less than 3 mos. of 89 yrs.
  In March 1879 He came to Brookton from Corfu N.Y. with his family and has lived among us nearly 29 years.
  He united with this Ch Dec. 13, 1896. A few remarks were made by Rev. Woodworth, Jan 3. The trend of thought was that a good man had gone - to which every heart present I feel sure responded. His interest in this Ch was unwavering and his loss seems irreparable. His body was taken to Corfu where his first wife and two sons are buried.
  In this connection it seems proper to mention the death of Mrs. Mary A. Mills, although she died Dec. 28, 1895, yet I find no mention of it in these records. She was born at Hempstead L. I. Feb 8, 1819. Mrs. Mills was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu N.Y. She united with this Ch by letter June 13, 1880. Her life was a blessing to all who knew her. She was a noble, consecrated Christian.

From book labelled "CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH 1868-1933 Minutes of meetings & Membership"

Different entries are separated by "---".(Book contains handwritten founding document of Congregational Church of Motts Corners! Book appears to have been rebound at least once as the binding covers handwritten text.)

At a regular meeting of the Congregational Church June 13, 1880, Mrs. Mary A. Mills was received as a member by letter from the First Presbyterian Church of Corfu.


  
Church Records and Baptism:
  - Entries mentioning Emily or Edward before they officially joined?  
  - Any information on this event from Park Church, any diaries of Reverend Ford Eastman?
  - Is there significance to the date? Easter was on 3/31 in 1907. 4/7 did fall on a Sunday
  - catalog all information about Annis Ford, including what I remember are a few return trips.
  - look at ithaca papers on, immediately after that day?

Hi! I am the church secretary of Calvary Presbyterian Church, Margaret Wegener. Currently we are closed due to Covid. We plan to reopen in June at which time I will check the church registers for any information pertaining to your research.
Off the top of my head, the church is about 148 or so years old. The members did meet in houses prior to the building going up. Records of that time are not likely to be in the current church.
It is possible that the family attended First Presbyterian Church which has been closed for some time. I understand their records are archived somewhere by Presbytery.
I will be in touch when I am able to get into the church office.
Margaret

Photos:

No known photos of any family members exist. The Rare and Manuscript Collection at Cornell contains seven boxes of scrapbooks created by E. D. Shurter and his wife Alice that have Brooktondale related content according to the catalog entry, so I am hopeful Emily and perhaps her store will be docuemented there: https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/2087800 .

The only known photo of M. E. Mills store front is from a 1915 photo in a book Gertrude Conant created for her son Ralph. The photo also shows the Mills home in the photo, and contains personal  


Physical artifacts:

Tompkins County Historical Society:
  - An entry in the notebooks of George Jansen record the death of Edward H. Mills. 
  - Independent Order of Good Templars notebook of meeting minutes in Emily Mill's handwriting, signed by Emily.
  - Independent Order of Good Templars form in Emily Mill's handwriting.
  
Other:
  - "A Note on Emily Mills" by Molly Adams makes reference to a leather booklet. 
        - Note: "TNT" is the former site of Mulks store and would later become Brookton's Market.
        - Errata: Hannah is Emily's step-mother.
      
  - A Caroline citizen has ledgers taken from the basement of Mills' store. Comparisons with known samples of Emily Mills' handwriting from the meeting minutes of Independent Order of Good Templars confirms these are the sales records and credit account ledgers of M. E. Mills general store. There were many volumes over many years.
  - Other ledgers from a general store, very similar in nature to the known Mills ledgers mentioned above, are housed at the Town of Caroline History Room. It is indicated they were donated by Frank Proto, who at the time owned the "old postoffce," the former location of the Mills store. When asked for more specifics, Barbara Kone said they were "from the mill" presumably referring to present Dalebrook apartments, which are built on the grist mill foundation. These ledgers have the same form factor and appear to use the same bookkeepping methods as M. E. Mills' ledgers, although this is perhaps to be expected. If they are more Mills ledgers, they would date to the time of Edward's ownership of the store. A more thorough examination is needed but so far, we have not found a clear example of Emily's handwriting in these books as we would expect, as we know that Emily was a clerk in her father's store in the early 1890's and was likely so from the time of Jonas' death. In fact, there appear to be multiple people's handwriting in these second set of books, suggesting these are more likely to belong to Mulk's store.

Genealogy of Edward H. Mills (1819-1908) parents and siblings.

583. Jonas Davis Mills (George , Isaac , Isaac , Timothy , Jonathan , George ) was born on 2 May 1795. He died on 30 Jan 1882.

Jonas married (1) Mary Hallock on 25 Dec 1818 in , Long Island, New York. Mary was born on 8 Dec 1798. She died on 2 Mar 1827.

They had the following children:

 	1029	M	i	  Thomas James Mills was born on 13 Feb 1817.
 	1030	M	ii	Edward H. Mills was born on 25 Mar 1819.
 	1031	F	iii	Emily Tabitha Mills was born on 19 Jun 1821. She died on 11 Apr 1849.
 	
Jonas married (2) Mary Platt Mills daughter of Jedediah Mills and Elizabeth Mills on 25 Apr 1831. Mary was born on 30 Jan 1801 in Long Island, New York. She died on 18 Jun 1881.

They had the following children:

 	1032	F	iv	Sarah Maria Mills is printed as #623.
 	1033	M	v	  Robert Sydney Mills is printed as #624.

Edward is ultimately descended from:

  24. Timothy Mills (Jonathan , George ) was born in 1667 in Jamaica, Long Island, Queens Co., New York. He died on 30 Mar 1751 in Mills Pond, Smithtown, Long Island, New York. 

The family were early settlers of Long Island. The Mills Pond District is named for them, and there is a Mills family cemetery there as well. Edward shares ancestry with William Wickam Mills

I've located the man who created the Mills genealogy, and at the very least can give him some information about the family. 

Looking back at my Market history, it looks like in the 1890's, the store was owned by Frank Vorhis, and I believe he owned the grist mill lot at the time as well. That fits with what Barbara said, that the books "came from the mill" and I could try to confirm that with Frank Proto. That would all make sense then, and would indicate these are the books of the Market from the time of Frank Vorhis, before Mulks bought it. We may have samples of Frank's handwriting in the history room that we could compare against those books? And if we confirm these are not Mills' books, then its an interesting look into the bookkeeping practices of the day, as Vorhis and MIlls would appear to have learned the same basic method separately.

  - The property was originally part of the mill lot.

  annah and father to Emily below, died January 1, 1908)

  - 1969, July 12: C. (Charles or Cornelius?) Dalton Jones and Clara B. Jones
  - 1979, November 14:	Lawrence E. and Janet L. Lattin (Janet operated a daycare in the home.)
  - 1992, August 27: Andrea Talmadge (and her partner John Callaghan who also lived there but was not named in any deeds.)
  - 2007, December 19: Adam J. Smith

I have had contact over the years with Andrea Talmadge, who gave me some details about the past layout of the house and earlier renovations made. She also kept a history of changes she made to the house that she gave to me, and I have similarly recorded the changes I have made for the next person. I've never been in contact with the Lattins, but last I knew, they are still living in Caroline

Here are a few remembrances from my correspondences with Andrea that folks might find interesting.

Both Andrea Talmadge and Frank Proto have told me that the property between 475 and Dalebrook Apartments was the location of a mill pond and the mill race flowed across Brooktondale Road and on through the Anderson's at 476 Brooktondale Road (the empty field between them and the Todi's) and back into Six Mile Creek. (Is this the "C. Mill" indicated on the 1866 Mott's Corners map, with the line being the mill race?)

The land in both places is slowly but continuously sinking because it was filled in with boulders. From Andrea: "Early on after moving there, I did have the unique and wonderful opportunity to meet an elderly man - Carl English who stopped by to chat while I was gardening. (Carl died in 1996 at 86 years old) He and his brothers were paid (when they were young lads) to fill that area in after the creek was re-routed and the mills were gone. This fill-in, while successful, resulted in fairly unstable land."

"Gracie Van Demark (yes, as in Van Demark Rd, ) told me that B'dale Rd and Valley Rd were not connected as they are now.  A large white house used to be somewhere between the old post office building and the Brookton Market - it was moved in order to re-arrange the course of 6 Mile Creek as well as the roads. [Andrea mentioned that the "large white house" was moved down Brooktondale Road, past where the Novelli's live today.] 

"There was a bridge near 475 giving it the nickname "bridge's house" or something like that." (A reference to the mill race bridge mentioned in the 1909 deed?)

Caroline Valley Community Church
The other surviving church in Brooktondale is the Caroline Valley Community Church, formerly the Caroline Valley Federated Church, formerly the Brookton Congregational Church. Members of the Old Reformed Church of America and the Brookton Methodist Church together formed the congregation in 1863. The building was the Varna Presbyterian Church, purchased and moved to a foundation built for the Methodist Church. The kerosene lamps were replaced by acetylene lights in 1921 and then by electric lights in 1925. The original steeple was blown down in a wind storm in 1925 and a new fiberglass steeple was lifted by crane and placed on the roof in 1977. The bell from the Dutch Reformed Church was installed in the steeple, completing our circle of church recycling. In 1890 the church had 96 members, dropping to 43 in 1910, the church now has 87 members. Today the church hosts the Christmas Country Store crafts fair each November and generally has a dinner on election night. (https://tompkinscountyny.gov/node/218)

"The death of Miss EMILY MILLS, a long time resident of Brooktondale, deserves more than passing notice. For some 30 years she conducted at this place the general store in which she formerly served as helper to her father.

"Reserved, unostentatious, and kindly, she aided materially the Caroline welfare directory by extending credit for groceries to many needy individuals. Paraphrasing the remarks of ROBERT G. INGERSOLL at his brother's funeral: If everyone to whom Miss Mills extended a helpful hand were to place a floral emblem upon her grave, she would sleep today amidst a wildnerness of flowers.

"A devoted member of the Congrational Church at this place, a teacher in the Sunday School, she went about her daily round of duties with Christian fortitude, a faithfulness that were greatly appreciated and will be long remembered by her host of friends who join in this tribute to the memory of one, who, even as her Great Exemplare, went about doing good.

(E.D. SHURTER (1863-1946))"

https://pocketsights.com/tours/tour/Brooktondale-The-Historic-Hamlet-of-Brooktondale-2179

The homes and buildings on this tour appeared on Historic Ithaca's That Old House Tour in 2014.

The hamlet of Brooktondale has seen many name changes since it was settled as a Military Tract land grant. By the early 1800s it was known as Cantinesville (or Cantine’s Mill), after General John Cantine. General Cantine arrived in central New York in 1789 and received a Military Tract parcel along Six Mile Creek, including land that is now Slaterville and Brooktondale. His son, John Jr., built a log cabin in 1798 in the Brooktondale area. In 1800 General Cantine built a gristmill near the cabin. A few years later, in 1804, John Jr. put up the first frame house in Cantinesville, cleared land, and grew crops to provide work for the mill. The first bridge across the creek was built above the mill in 1825.

In 1825 Cantinesville was transformed when William Mott II bought John Cantine’s property. The town, called Mott’s Hollow or Mottville, became Mott’s Corners with the opening of a post office in 1836. Mott owned six mills, several stores, and a furniture factory. He also built houses for families who cleared and farmed his land and produced lumber for him. In 1834 Mott built a new grist mill on the south side of Six Mile Creek and erected a grand Greek Revival-style house across the street.

Other businesses in Mott's Corners included a tannery, a foundry, a brickyard, and a gun shop. Workers began to lay rail tracks near Mott’s Corners as early as 1870, allowing industry to expand in the area. In 1889 a “spidery” steel bridge replaced the “burly” wooden railroad trestle that had spanned the valley.

The name of the town was changed to Brookton in 1883 because of confusion with a Mottsville near Syracuse. In 1926 the name changed again, this time to its current name of Brooktondale.

Brooktondale has a long farming history due to its abundant silt loam soil. After the Civil War, the newly constructed railroads transported the area’s ample agricultural products to other parts of the state. Hay, wheat, milk, and cheese were all shipped to New York City via train. Today several “Century Farms” surround Brooktondale; these farms have remained in the same family for more than 100 years.

Throughout the early twentieth century, Brooktondale was threatened by flooding, with residents moving many houses from precarious locations along the creek banks to higher ground. A severe flood in 1905 damaged many of the buildings lining Six Mile Creek, leading to a reduction in milling and industry in the hamlet. At the same time, the introduction of electricity reduced the need for water power provided by the creek.

During World War I, family farms were unable to produce large yields due to labor shortages. During the Depression, many area farms were abandoned and then reclaimed by New York State. In 1935, the last train ran through Brooktondale and the trestle was demolished in 1936.

After World War II, Brooktondale grew as a residential area less dependent on farming, with more residents commuting to work in Ithaca. Today, both the Community Center (built in 1964) and Brookton’s Market serve as gathering places for what is now a primarily residential neighborhood.

The Mills family, early settlers of the Town of Smithtown, developed a rural agricultural community around Mills Pond. Occupied by the prosperous Mills family until 1976, this area is a rare survival of an agricultural hamlet once common on Long Island. William Wickham Mills inherited the family land and began to construct the Mills Pond House in 1838. He was a man of wealth and social prominence, being a successful farmer, stock breeder, and business man. He invested extensively in land and novel enterprises, such as the Long Island Railroad.
