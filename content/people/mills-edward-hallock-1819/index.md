## Information Yet To Be Incorporated

Several major areas are still missing from this history that are all very valuable to better understanding Emily:

  - Mills' store sales ledgers.
  - Temperance activity.
  - Fill out Hannah's first marriage, children.
  - Many more newspaper clippings about Hannah and Emily.
  - Ellen Gould.
  - Summary of census data.
  - References to other secondary historical accounts mentioning Emily. 
  - More legal research on deeds for Mills' home and store, estates, etc.
  - General information about Brooktondale during Emily's life.
  - Aknowledge the many people who have helped me along the way...

I have already collected much of this information, its just a matter of getting it organized here.

## Genealogy

By corroborating data from [Caroline Valley Community Church's historical records](#combined-church-obituary-entry-for-edward-and-mary-ann) as well as information about Edward's parents in the official recoreds of his marriage to [Hannah](http://localhost:1313/people/mills-edward-hallock-1819/#hannah-mills), Edward H. Mills is identified in a partial entry on an extensive genealogy: [Descendants of George Mills of Yorkshire and Long Island, New York](millsancestry.org). The site is now defunct and the contact information for it is no longer valid, however, I was able to locate its creator on Facebook to let him know about this documentation on Edward. 

Beginning with Edward's parents:

<figure>
<blockquote>

<span>583.</span> [Jonas Davis Mills](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138421270/jonas-d.-mills) (George , Isaac , Isaac , Timothy , Jonathan , George ) was born on 2 May 1795. He died on 30 Jan 1882.

Jonas married (1) [Mary Hallock](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138421346/mary-p.-mills) on 25 Dec 1818 in , Long Island, New York. Mary was born on 8 Dec 1798. She died on 2 Mar 1827.

They had the following children:

- 1029	M	i	Thomas James Mills was born on 13 Feb 1817.
- 1030	M	ii	Edward H. Mills was born on 25 Mar 1819.
- 1031	F	iii	Emily Tabitha Mills was born on 19 Jun 1821. She died on 11 Apr 1849.

Jonas married (2) Mary Platt Mills daughter of Jedediah Mills and Elizabeth Mills on 25 Apr 1831. Mary was born on 30 Jan 1801 in Long Island, New York. She died on 18 Jun 1881.

They had the following children:

- 1032	F	iv	Sarah Maria Mills is printed as #623.
- 1033	M	v	Robert Sydney Mills is printed as #624.

And to this we can add Edward's branch to its ultimate conclusion:

**Edward Hallock Mills** (born Smithtown NY, Mar 25, 1819, died Brookton NY, Jan 1, 1908).

Wife: **Mary Ann (Pine) Mills** (born Hempstead NY, Feb 8, 1819, died Brookton NY, Dec. 28, 1895). Married on Dec 29, 1850. 

Children:
  - **Jonas E. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1852, died Brookton NY, Oct 13, 1885).
  - **Horace F. Mills** (born Staten Island NY, 1854, died Corfu NY, October 27, 1876).
  - **Mary Emily Mills** who went by "Emily" and often signed her name as "M. Emily Mills" (born Staten Island NY, 1861, died Brooktondale NY, Nov 3, 1937).
  
None of Edward's children married or had children.

Wife: **Hannah (Thatcher) Eastman Mills** (1825?, died Brooktondale NY, Feb 25, 1917). Married on Dec 30, 1896. (No children from the marriage to Edward.)

Notes:
  - The only source of Horace's exact date of death is a listing from Evergreen Hill Cemetery, so this date should be verified.
  - Edward's middle name Hallock was his Mother's maiden name.
  - Jonas was Edward's father's name.
  - Edward had a sister named Emily who may have lent her name to Edward's daughter.
 
Edward H. Mills' ancestors were early settlers of the Town of Smithtown and to this day the [Mills Pond District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_Pond_District_(St._James,_New_York)) is named for them:

 <figure>
 <blockquote>
It was Timothy Mills who bought the land from one of our town founder's sons in 1693, according to "Colonel Rockwell's Scrap-Book" published by the Smithtown Historical Society in 1968. As the sons of Timothy Mills married, houses were built around the pond found on the land.

In the early 1700s, the area became known as Mills Pond. According to the Smithtown Township Arts Council's website, the area was originally called Cuttscunsuck, which means two small ponds in the Algonquian language.

## Horace F. Mills 

Horace is the single biggest mystery in the family, all the more so because his death seems to be a pivotal event in the family's history:

{{% mefigure "images/evergreen-hill-cemetery-51.jpg" "Evergreen Hills Cemetery, Corfu, directory listing, cropped image, page 51 is indicated in original, received by email May 21, 2021, personal correspondence with Diana Reding, Library Director at Corfu Public Library."  %}}
<footer>
Notes:

  - Obviously, Edward's date of death is incorrect. The only connection with Jan 6 is the publication of his obituaries.

</footer>
{{% /mefigure %}}

Presumably, the fact that the family moved away from Corfu a few years after his death is more than coincidental, but that is speculation. However, this could also explain why Emily was so active in the [temperance movement](#temperance-activity), if alcohol was a factor in Horace's death.

It is unlikely that the exact details of Horace's death would have ever been recorded, but I continue to search for clues:

  - I have contacted the Batavia Daily News for help as they may have old editions that have not yet been digitized and made publicly available, and therefore, currently outside my ability to pursue in any other way. Although there may not be an account of his death, he may be featured in other reporting that may shed light on his life circumstances. (Then again, it appears that suicides were regularly reported on in that time.)
  - I have taken an initial photographic inventory of every page of the Good Templars meeting minutes and will read these more closely for clues.

And a very big mystery relevant to the Caroline audience in particular, is why they chose Mott's Corners as their next destination? At this point, I have only a few vague theories to explore.

  - If the Caroline area was a particularly active area for Temperance, that could have been a draw. But, it is unclear if anyone in Emily's family were involved in temperance.
  - They knew someone who lived Mott's Corners.
  - Perhaps Edward sold products from the mills and factories of Mott's Corners in his store and knew of it that way?

Emily fell and broke her hip while on her way to services at Brookton Congregational Church on October 10, 1937. She would spend the last several weeks of her life in Memorial Hospital where she died on November 3, at 76 years old.

This moving tribute was authored by none other than E. D. Shurter, a Brookton native who was at different times, an attorney, a college professor and a nationally renowned orator and author. This is Emily's only known obituary and is referenced elsewhere as such:

Notes:

  - The reference to "lot of said M. E. Mills" seems to be a ontinued reference to the house lot and using "M. E. Mills" as just an abbreviation of Emily's name and not an explicit reference to the store. That is the most logical way to read the sentence, and also, I don't believe that Emily owned the real estate of the store. 
  - An identical notice also ran the next day, Jan 20, 1938, in the Ithaca Journal.

## E. H. Mills & Co., Corfu NY 

Not much is known of E. H. Mills & Co. of Corfu:

<figure>
<blockquote>
The E.H. Mills General store was on the NE corner of Main and Allegheny in Corfu.  It was open from 1866-1880. The building burned to the ground in a fire in 1899.  It is now the site of the M&T Bank building.

The following map images and associated business directory show both the E. H. Mills & Co. general store as well as the Mills' home in Corfu in the same locations in 1866 and 1876:

By 1876, the year that Horace died, Corfu had grown, but E. H. Mills & Co. and the Mills' home are still there:

The Mills' home in Corfu no longer exists.

## E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills, Brookton

Two articles in the Jul 14, 1934 (page 3) and Nov 20, 1934 (page  5) issues of The Ithaca Journal tell of $135 in cash being stolen from M. E. Mills while Emily "was at lunch." Despite the information being publicly available, I have chosen not to republish it here out of respect to any descendents of the accused.

It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.

These records show us how Emily's store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920's, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward's entries decades before, these are more modern books that also tracked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had "specimen" pages to teach how to use the forms within.

## Temperance Activity

### Distribution

To preserve this information, and as an aid to future researchers, the following organizations should receive a copy of this information:

  - Town of Caroline History Room
  - Tompkins County History Center
  - Caroline Valley Community Church
  - Cornell University for possible inclusion with other Caroline materials.
  - Town of Corfu Historians
  - Smithtown Historical Society
  - Mills Pond?

### Notes for Future Researchers

There is an Edward H. Mills and a corresponding E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY in the 1880's that was a "knitting factory" and one that is written about in some detail in local historical accounts. This appears to be a completely different family based on the following city directories that list family members who are unaccounted for in the Mills Genealogy and are not documented in anything else we know about the Mills. 

{{% mefigure "images/1882-gloversville-directory-p85.jpg" "**The Gloversville, Johnstown and Kingsboro Directory for 1882-3**, p85." /%}}

{{% mefigure "images/1886-gloversville-directory-p77.jpg" "**Gloversville, Johnstown City Directory 1886**, p77" /%}}

There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800's, who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos can be found of him online.

A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.

### Unanswered Questions and Areas of Further Research

  - More precise birthdates and birthplaces for Jonas, Horace, Emily.
  - Jonas' and Horace's full middle names.
  - Corroborate Horace's date of death, as Evergreen Hill Cemetery directory listing is the only source of a date and given the mistakes in Edward's listing, I can't be completely confident in it.
  - Is Charles M. Pine, co-owner of E. H. Mills & Co. in Corfu, related to Edward's wife Mary Ann, whose maiden name is Pine?
  - Photo of anyone in Mills family, the stores, the homes, but in particular, a photo of Emily and her store in Brookton, M. E. Mills. 
  - Find the leather booklet mentioned by Molly Adams, at one time in the Caroline History Room, and photograph it.

Horace's Death:
  - Presumably why the family moved *away from* Corfu?
  - But why *to* Mott's Corners?
  - The nature of Horace's death, and was alcohol a significant factor? Presumably this will never be knowable, but perhaps there will be clues in the Good Templars notebooks.

Church Records and Baptism:
  - Entries mentioning Emily or Edward before they officially joined?  
  - Any information on this event from Park Church, any diaries of Reverend Ford Eastman?
  - Is there significance to the date? Easter was on 3/31 in 1907. 4/7 did fall on a Sunday
  - Catalog all information about Reverend Annis Ford Eastman, including her return trips, see if Emily's baptism was the Rev's last visit to Brookton.
  
Planned:
  - research deeds on Mill's home and Mill's store prior to 1900.
  - Photo inventory and digitally transcribe the complete notebook of Good Templars meeting minutes. Try to find a link between Horace's death and Emily's temperance activities, and a possible clue to Mott's Corners move.
  - Research Emily's baptism, possibly contacting descendents of Annis Ford Eastman for information on that event. 
  - The dimenions and timing of the ("approximately") 1915 photo of Brooktondale Road that shows the front of M. E. Mills and the Mill's home could have been taken by Alice Shurter?
  

### Physical Artifacts Remaining

The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this. 

There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter House next door (the Shurter House sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton). 

In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection. 

Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866.

We actually have copious amounts of Emily's handwriting spanning many decades:
  - A complete notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880's. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization. These items are kept in the Tompkins County Historical Society archives.
  - The sales ledgers of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920's were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The ledgers are in excellent condition, and we can match Emily's handwriting to the known examples from the Good Templars notes. See [Mill's Store Ledgers](). 
  

[A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), mentions "a little leatherette booklet" identified with M. E. Mills, and I am attempting to locate it.

### Historical Names

Brooktondale:
  - from late 1700's: Cantineville or Cantine's Mill and a number of other variants.
  - 1840: Mott's Corners (often spelled Motts Corners)
  - 1883: Brookton
  - Feb 16, 1926: Brooktondale

As a nod to Brooktondale's history, several local businesses have adopted "Brookton" as part of their name, most notably Brookton's Market.

Brooktondale Road:


Caroline Valley Community Church:


Brookton's Market:

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.

<footer>
Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" and prior to that, the location of M. E. Mills, is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})
  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

In the Caroline History Room, there is a copy of Molly's familiar-looking research notes that organizes her research on the Mills family and forms the basis of the more narrative "Note" above. Although largely a repetition of what is in the "Note" and elsewhere, this document is important as it contains further historical context and most importantly, indicates the sources of the quotes in the "Note":

{{% mefigure "images/a-note-on-emily-mills-research-notes.jpg" "Molly Adams via Caroline History Room files." /%}}

The date of these notes suggests that perhaps the "Note" that Molly gave me was something she created specifically for whoever the new owner would be, and was designed specifically to pique interest in Emily. Thank you Molly, you were a great teacher, I wish I had been a better student.



### Gertrude Conant's Recollections

{{% mefigure "images/conant-gertrude-1.jpg" "Gertrude Conant, used with permission."  %}}
<footer>
Notes:

  - Dr. Benjamin Lockwood's house is present day 480 Brooktondale Road. Later, "Dr. Mary" Ridgway Tinker would live and practice there for a time. He was also a member of Brookton Congregational and built the Dalebrook apartments on the foundation of the Grist Mill in the 1920's. After Dr. Lockwood's death, E. D. Shurter placed a plaque in his honor outside Dalebrook that remains today.
  - The "woman who lived in and kept house" whose name Gertrude couldn't remember, is a reference to Ellen Gould.

### Churches in Corfu 

We know that Mary Ann was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Corfu, but the interconnections with the Congregationalists is interesting nonetheless:

The Congregationalist Church was active in Corfu from 1810-1830s. It never had its own building. It spent a few years as part of the Presbyterian Church,  then ceased to exist.

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Village Historian:

<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

<blockquote>
I do not have any records from the church on hand, prior to the early 1900s.  Our church started in 1814, which means she would have been involved in our church at the very early years of our church opening as Pembroke Society. 

I did send out a message to see if there are still any records from the start of the church, but truth be told, back then, record keeping wasn't exactly a big thing. and if anything was still available, it would have been transferred over, and over again.

### Edward H. Mills and E. H. Mills & Co. in Gloversville NY 



### The Baptism of Emily Mills

Emily Mills and Jessie Shurter were baptized in the same ceremony, officiated by none other than the Reverend Annis Ford Eastman.

Notes:

  - The uneven pen strokes and differences in intensity of ink show that the original record was written in fountain pen, with the lighter, marginal notes added later with lead pencil. The consistency of the pencil marks suggests these notes were all added at the same time.

In 1907, April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter. It was to be the final year of Edward's life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward's health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.

It is interesting to note the care taken to quote the scripture verse used in the sermon, as it is a translation that uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:

<figure>
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.

Notes:

  - Despite how it appears on her tombstone, Alleine was married to Harry Van Order (1891-1918) first on Dec 17, 1910, then married William Lyman Peck (1875-1960) on Jan 23, 1935.
  - Louise Ward (Shurter) Henderson is the neice of E. D. Shurter.

I could not find an account of this baptism in the Ithaca Journal, but there is this entry over a week later in the Elmira Gazette and Free Press, that, despite some glaring innaccuracies that can be explained, appears to reference the event:

Notes:

  - Brookton was often confused with Brocton and  Brooklyn, and that is the reason for adopting the name Brooktondale. See [Historical Names](#historical-names). Otherwise, the use of "village" doesn't make sense.
  - It is referencing the wrong weekend, but it is also a relative time reference, and perhaps the difference is just a result of the time between writing and publishing.
  - The reference to the Denmans would seem to be Richard L. Denman (1848-1915) and his wife Adelaide (1852-1947).

At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily's mother Mary Ann was the only in the family on the Church rolls, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. In the Reverend's account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who "waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me." (From **Enjoyment of Living** by Max Eastman, pg 70.)



### More information about Emily's Baptism 

**Reverend Annis Ford Eastman** officiated the ceremony. She made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in "The Making of a Woman Minister" in the book **Enjoyment of Living** by her son Max Eastman. The Church's historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the "picked council" she refers to in her account. The Church's records indicate that the Reverend did return to Brookton periodically in the years after she left. The Reverend would die in 1910 after a period of ill health, so this would have been one of her last return visits.

The Deacons listed are:

  - **[Cantine Lounsbery](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/89338791/cantine-lounsbery)** (1831-1910)
  - **[Harvey Smiley](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24763291/harvey-smiley)** (?-1917)
  - **[Orange Munson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/95123044/orange-munson)** (1834-1910):
      - Via findagrave.com: "Orange, the son of Joseph, was born Aug 4 1834; married Mary (his 2nd cousin) Feb 18 1855; and after her death he married Johanna Ada Richardson. He was a farmer in 1880. They resided in Brookton, NY [Src: Munson Record V2. Myron Munson. p. 1091, 1112]" Caroline Valley Community Church records from the time have a record of Orange and Ada Munson moving to Erin NY Aug 30, 1918 and needing a letter to transfer to the Methodist Church there.


**Jessie (Shurter) Brewer (1881-1974)**

  - Married Lewis William Brewer (1882-1963).
  - As mentioned in [A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), Jessie (Shurter) Brewer grew up in the Shurter House next to M. E. Mills and she would eventually purchase the Mills' home and M. E. Mills after Emily's death.


**Susie C. (Westfall) Lawrence (1885-1977)**

  - Married Woodley Lawrence (1885-1931).


**Lettie Delphene Personius (1892-1909)**

  - Lettie Personius, aged 16 years, died at City Hospital yesterday of gangrenous appendicitis. Miss Personious was the daughter of Postmaster Jacob Wilson Personius (1866-1906) of Caroline Depot, who was killed by a Lackawanna freight train near his home on Dec. 14, 1906.
