[^1]: Brookton was renamed to Brooktondale in 1926. See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}}). In general, I will use "Brooktondale" unless in the given context, the historical name will make more sense. Since death records obviously reference historical names, I have preserved them here so as not to create confusion.

## E. H. Mills & Co., Corfu NY 

The following two images are a map and associated business directory from 1866 showing the E. H. Mills & Co. as well as the Mills' home in Corfu:

## E. H. Mills and M. E. Mills, Brookton

It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.

These records show us how Emily's store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920's, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward's entries decades before, these are more modern books that also racked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had "specimen" pages to teach how to use the forms within.

## Appendix

### Notes for Future Researchers

There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800's, who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos can be found of him online.

A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.

### Unanswered Questions and Areas of Further Research

  - More precise birthdates and birthplaces for Jonas, Horace, Emily.
  - Jonas' and Horace's full middle names.
  - Photo of anyone in Mills family, the stores, the homes, but in particular, a photo of Emily and her store in Brookton, M. E. Mills. 

Horace's Death:
  - Presumably why the family moved *away from* Corfu?
  - But why *to* Mott's Corners?
  - The nature of Horace's death, and was alcohol a significant factor? Presumably this will never be knowable, but perhaps there will be clues in the Good Templars notebooks.

Church Records and Baptism:
  - Entries mentioning Emily or Edward before they officially joined?  
  - Any information on this event from Park Church, any diaries of Reverend Ford Eastman?
  - Is there significance to the date? Easter was on 3/31 in 1907. 4/7 did fall on a Sunday
  - Catalog all information about Reverend Annis Ford Eastman, including her return trips, see if Emily's baptism was the Rev's last visit to Brookton.
  - Look at Ithaca papers on, immediately after that day?
  
Planned:
  - Photo inventory and digitally transcribe the complete notebook of Good Templars meeting minutes. Try to find a link between Horace's death and Emily's temperance activities, and a possible clue to Mott's Corners move.
  - Research Emily's baptism, possibly contacting descendents of Annis Ford Eastman for information on that event. 
  - The dimenions and timing of the ("approximately") 1915 photo of Brooktondale Road that shows the front of M. E. Mills and the Mill's home could have been taken by Alice Shurter?
  

### Physical Artifacts Remaining

The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this. 

There are relevant photos taken from the hills above and behind the Mills' store that show the roof and outline of the building. The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter Hotel next door (the Shurter Hotel sat between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton). 

In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, purportedly taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, it appears quite small, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection. 

Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866.

We actually have copious amounts of Emily's handwriting spanning many decades:
  - A complete notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880's. There is also an original copy of a form filed with the organization. These items are kept in the Tompkins County Historical Society archives.
  - The sales ledgers of M. E. Mills general store from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920's were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store several decades later, thanks to then owner Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph several of the books. The ledgers are in excellent condition, and we can match Emily's handwriting to the known examples from the Good Templars notes. See [Mill's Store Ledgers](). 
  

[A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), mentions "a little leatherette booklet" identified with M. E. Mills, and I am attempting to locate it.

### Historical Names

Brooktondale:
  - from late 1700's: Cantineville or Cantine's Mill and a number of other variants.
  - 1840: Mott's Corners (often spelled Motts Corners)
  - 1883: Brookton
  - Feb 16, 1926: Brooktondale

As a nod to Brooktondale's history, several local businesses have adopted "Brookton" as part of their name, most notably Brookton's Market.

Brooktondale Road:


Caroline Valley Community Church:


Brookton's Market:

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.

Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})
  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

### Churches in Corfu 

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Town Historian:

<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.

### The Baptism of Emily Mills

Emily Mills and Jessie Shurter were baptized in the same ceremony, officiated by none other than the Reverend Annis Ford Eastman.

{{% mefigure "images/mills-emily-cvcc-baptism.jpg" "Entry in **Congregational Church 1868-1933 Minutes of meetings and Membership**, used here with permisson from Caroline Valley Community Church." %}}
<footer>
Notes:

  - In 1907, April 7th fell on the Sunday after Easter.

  - The uneven pen strokes and differences in intensity of ink show that the original record was written in fountain pen, with the lighter, marginal notes added later with lead pencil. The consistency of the pencil marks suggests these notes were all added at the same time.

This baptism took place in the final year of Edward's life. He and his second wife Hannah had both been members of the Church for just over a decade at that point, and depending on Edward's health at that time, we can assume that he and Hannah would have been present for the ceremony that day.

It is interesting to note the care taken to quote the scripture verse used in the sermon, which uniquely identifies it with the King James Version of the Bible. Therefore, we can know some of the exact words spoken that day by Reverend Ford Eastman:

<figure>
<blockquote>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</blockquote>
<figcaption>â€” <cite>Luke 13:24, King James Bible</cite></figcaption>

This event and its recording are unusual in several respects, and deserving of further investigation. The record itself is quite unique in the amount of detail compared to similar records elsewhere in the same book. The number of people being baptized in one event also seems unusual for a congregation that size (it seemed more typical to have a small handful of people baptized in a year, and to not necessarily be grouped together) and may be related to the other notable fact: that eleven of the fifteen people are unmarried women (and two others were first degree relatives of women in that group of eleven). Add to this, the fact that Reverend Annis Ford Eastman returned to officiate this event, and a rough outline of what was happening begins to suggest itself, along with the significance that the cited scripture would have for the Reverend and these women.

The Reverend Annis Ford Eastman made history by becoming one of the first women ordained in a Congregational Church while she was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church (now Caroline Valley Community Church) from 1889 to 1891. The Reverend wrote of her time in Brookton, including an account of her ordination, in "The Making of a Woman Minister" in the book **Enjoyment of Living** by her son Max Eastman. The Church's historical records also include an account of her ordination, including the names of the members of the "picked council" she refers to in her account. The Church's records indicate that the Reverend did return to Brookton periodically in the years after she left. The Reverend would die in 1910 after a period of ill health, so this would have been one of her last return visits.

At the time that the Reverend Ford Eastman was pastor of Brookton Congregational Church, Emily's mother Mary Ann was the only official member of the Church, so it is unclear how much exposure Emily would have had to the Reverend while she was pastor. In the Reverend's account of her first visit to Brookton, one imagines that it is likely that Mary Ann, and possibly Emily too, were among those who "waited in the dim light of the smoky kerosene lamps to speak to me."

As mentioned in [A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), Jessie (Shurter) Brewer would eventually purchase the Mills' home and M. E. Mills after Emily's death.
