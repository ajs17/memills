Notes:
  - Mary Ann's maiden name is sometimes mis-transcribed as "Pine."

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})

  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

### Churches in Corfu 

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Town Historian:

<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.
