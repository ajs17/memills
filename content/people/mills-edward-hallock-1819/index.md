[^1]: Brookton was renamed to Brooktondale in 1926. See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}}).

Since death records obviously reference historical names, I have preserved them here so as not to create confusion.

Notes:
  - Variations of Edward's middle name exist, such as "Hallioch" and "Halloch" however these seem to be errors as Edward's middle name appears to be taken from his mother's maiden name: "Hallock."

### E. H. Mills & Co., Corfu NY

By 1876, the year that Horace died, Corfu had grown, but E. H. Mills & Co. and the Mills' home are still there:

### M. E. Mills 

In [A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills),

It is interesting to note that in the sales ledgers, the store was closed on Sundays, but if Christmas fell on any other day of the week, the store was open and had a fairly typical flow of customers.

These records show us how Emily's store accounting evolved over time, beginning with small changes after Edward died and by the 1920's, her business records are quite a bit more complete and sophisticated. In addition to the normal sales ledgers that look very similar to Edward's entries decades before, these are more modern books that also racked suppliers and were much more structured. These books had "specimen" pages to teach how to use the forms within.

## Appendix

### Notes for Future Researchers

other Horace Mills, EH Mills & Co.

There is another Horace F. Mills in upstate New York in the 1800's, who does not appear to be related to this Mills family. That Horace Mills was born in 1847, lived in Penn Yan NY, attended the University at Albany in 1861 but left to serve in the Civil War, ultimately rising to the rank of Major in the 9th USCT. Several photos can be found of him online.

A thorough review of the seven boxes of scrapbooks of Edwin Dubois and Alice Shurter in the Cornell University Library archives did not yield any photos or other documentation related to the Mills family. In fact, the Brookton/Caroline related materials were in the minority, and there were few original photographic prints overall.

### Unanswered Questions and Areas of Further Research

  - More precise birthdates and birthplaces for Jonas, Horace, Emily.
  - Jonas' and Horace's full middle names.
  - Photo of anyone in Mills family, the stores, the homes, but in particular, a photo of Emily and her store in Brookton, M. E. Mills. 

Horace's Death:
  - Presumably why the family moved *away from* Corfu?
  - But why *to* Mott's Corners?
  - The nature of Horace's death, and was alcohol a significant factor? Presumably this will never be knowable, but perhaps there will be clues in the Good Templars notebooks.

Planned:
  - Photo inventory and digitally transcribe the complete notebook of Good Templars meeting minutes. Try to find a link between Horace's death and Emily's temperance activities, and a possible clue to Mott's Corners move.
  - Research Emily's baptism, possibly contacting descendents of Annis Ford Eastman for information on that event. 
  

### Physical Artifacts Remaining

The original structures of both the Mills' store in Brooktondale and the Mills' home in Brooktondale still exist at the time I write this. 

Maps of Corfu from the time show the locations of E. H. Mills and the Mills' home in 1866.

We actually have copious amounts of Emily's handwriting spanning many decades:
  - The sales ledgers of M. E. Mills from the final year of E. H. Mills (1907) through at least the early 1920's were salvaged from the basement of the Mills' store some decades later, thanks to Frank Proto offering them to a local collecter who still has them as I write this, and who has allowed me to view and photograph them. See [Mill's Store Ledgers](). 
  - A complete notebook of meeting minutes for the temperance organization The Independent Order of Good Templars, beginning in the early 1880's. (Also, form)

The storefront of M. E. Mills is visible in the background, mostly obstructed, in photos that feature the Shurter Hotel next door (between the Mills' store and the lower bridge over Six Mile Creek in Brookton). 

In a book of local history that Gertrude Conant created for her son, there is a photo that includes the front of M. E. Mills, with the Mills' home in the background, taken approximately 1915. So far, we have only seen a photo of this photo, and the store front appears to be over-exposed, hiding much detail. It is expected that this book will be donated to the Caroline Historian in the future, and we will be able to get a better look at it. We are also hopeful that an original print and/or negative exists somewhere in the collection.

[A Note on Emily Mills](#a-note-on-emily-mills), mentions "a little leatherette booklet" identified with M. E. Mills, and I am attempting to locate it.

### Historical Names

Brooktondale:
  - from late 1700's: Cantineville or Cantine's Mill and a number of other variants.
  - 1840: Mott's Corners (often spelled Motts Corners)
  - 1883: Brookton
  - Feb 16, 1926: Brooktondale

As a nod to Brooktondale's history, several local businesses have adopted "Brookton" as part of their name, most notably Brookton's Market.

Brooktondale Road:


Caroline Valley Community Church:


Brookton's Market:

### A Note on Emily Mills by Molly Adams

Despite its title, this exceptional account by Molly Adams is more about the M. E. Mills store than it is about Emily herself.

Shortly after I moved into the Mills' home in Brooktondale, Molly Adams visited me to sign me up for the Old Mill newsletter, and to give me the following history of Emily Mills and her store. I have since been told that this was a ritual Molly performed with other newcomers. Although I read this "Note" with some interest initially, I didn't appreciate its importance until several years too late to ask Molly to teach me more. I at least had the foresight to save it somewhere I could find it again years later when I needed it. I revisit this often, still mining it for clues about Emily, trying to learn what Molly knew.

Notes:

  - The "old postoffice" is present-day 484 Brooktondale Road.
  - "TNT" refers to the store that is presently Brookton's Market and was owned by the Mulks in early 1900's.  See [Historical Names]({{< relref "#historical-names" >}})
  - The source of the quotes about the Mills' home are from the property deeds of the time. 
  - The source of the quote in the last paragraph about extending credit is taken from E. D. Shurter's tribute in the Ithaca Journal.
  - Erratum: Hannah Mills was Emily's step-mother.

### Churches in Corfu 

The following histories were provided via personal correspondence with Allan Starkweather, Corfu Town Historian:

<figure>
  <blockquote>
  <h5>Congregationalist Church</h5>

  The Rev. John Spencer established a Congregationalist Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1810. It was the first religious society in the Pembroke area. A permanent building was never built, they would occasionally meet at various homes. The Rev. Spencer had trouble finding people who were interested in religion. It was said that, "religion had not gone west of the Genesee River."

  When the Presbyterian Church was founded in 1817 the Congregationalists combined with them. By the 1840s most of them were gone.

  <h5>Presbyterian Church</h5>

  The Rev. Hugh Wallis Founded the Presbyterian Church at Long's Corners [Corfu] in 1817. The constitution for the "First Presbyterian Society in Pembroke" drawn up in 1818. They build a building at 63 Allegany in 1831. And it is still in use today.
  
  There was a lot of dissention in the church by 1831. Two factions of Presbyterians and the Congregationalists were doing a lot of bickering. The Genesee Presbytery recommended that the church be dissolved. Later in 1831, the church was disbanded and the "Presbyterian Church of N. Pembroke" was formed. Most of the records of the first church were destroyed. In 1834, it was renamed the "Corfu United Presbyterian Church." The Congregationalist's never did reform.
