fulltext:into leather. Hemlock and white oak grew in the region, but red oak was preferred because of its greater tannin content. Oaks ranged from 8 to 10 per cent tannin; hemlock, 7 to 8 per cent. Hemlock tanning virtually came to an end in America in 1890 when British interests began to dominate the industry and specialize in oak tanning.

Where the timber was not to be used for lumber, the boles of the trees were left on the ground to decay. During the spring of 1896 the writer worked with a group of five men and boys in collecting for firewood knots from hemlock trees that had been peeled three or four decades before. Swinging a sledge hammer, a man knocked the knots from the rotted boles and the boys piled them into heaps convenient for hauling to the farmhouse. As fuel, these resin-filled knots burned with such heat as to warp kitchen stoves and parlor heaters.

After the bark had been ground and mixed with water in the vats at the tannery, there came a time when the tannin had been extracted and used in the process. There then remained the inert woody part of the bark, for which an unusual use was foundâ€”filling. At one time Washington Park in Ithaca had its paths built up above the mud line with refuse from the local tannery.

Farming Without Wagons

When the pioneers came into Caroline or, for that matter, the Upstate wilderness, they came mostly by oxcarts and sleds. Wagons could scarcely be afforded by the migrants, and on the trails or early roads wheeled vehicles were of little or no use. For hauling hay and straw on the farm, in lieu of a wagon a large brush or tree top was loaded in the field and hauled to the barn or stack by a yoke of oxen. Not infrequently a smaller brush load was carried by two men; lacking storage facilities, the new farmer stacked his early crop of native grass. Before timothy and clover displaced the wild crop, several years were spent in planting and experimenting with different grasses.

Until the farmers had established pastures, his livestock fed
