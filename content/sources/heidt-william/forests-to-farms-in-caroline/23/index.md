fulltext:Native Son Became Michigan Governor

George Blair of Worcester, Mass., came into the Caroline wilderness in 1809. He was unmarried, as was Sabin Mann who came with him; later Mann married Rhoda Blackman. Drafted into the army during the War of 1812, he was killed, and Blair married his widow. It was their son Austin who became the Civil War governor of Michigan, 1861-65. Previously, he had been county clerk and prosecutor; later he served three terms as congressman. Born in 1818, Blair died in 1894.

The Blair Homestead, on a town road two miles north of Speedsville, still stands, with a small family burying ground near it. A marker identifies this place.

A marker 2  miles east of Brooktondale commemorates the Quick Homestead. This house was built in 1823 by Henry Quick and Sally Earsley Quick, the latter a daughter of Widow Earsley. The Quick family came from Ulster County and were members of the “Marbletown Dutch” contingent of Caroline settlers.

Some “Firsts” in Caroline

There is a significance in “firsts” found in the records of pioneer communities. After the settler in the vast forests had secured his family’s shelter and food, his next thought was of the society in which they were to dwell. Consequently, a list of these firsts record informally development of that social order, their respective dates indicating his idea of the importance of each by its chronology. Read with this thought in mind, we learn much of the type of persons who came early to Caroline and their purpose in coming.

The first log house was erected by Capt. David Rich in 1795.

The first frame house was the old “Mansion House” erected by Gen. John Cantine in 1801.

The first gristmill and the first sawmill were built by Gen. John Cantine at Brooktondale in 1808.
