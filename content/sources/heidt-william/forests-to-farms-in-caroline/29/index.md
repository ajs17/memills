fulltext:‘When it came time for the pioneer farmer to harvest his hay, he mowed it by hand with a scythe and raked it with a hand rake. Machines were not available, and had they been their use would have been limited. Stumps and other obstructions and uneven surfaces defeated machines for many years. Grain was first cut with a sickle, the grain cradle being unusable until field obstructions were overcome. The straw lay in a regular swath which was raked by hand into sheaves that were stacked in shocks to ripen fully. Each shock wore a “cap” made by spreading a sheaf and inverting it over the shock to protect the grain from rain. Sheaves were bound by wythes made by twisting the heads of a small bundle of straw from the sheaf in such a manner that the heads feld firmly. Making the band and capping the shock required clever skill.

The grain cradle was a scythe equipped with a four-fingered “hand” above the cutting blade. After the straw was cut, it lodged against the fingers in an orderly manner and was deposited in an even swath that permitted raking into sheaves. It required a strong back to swing a cradle all day, especially when the straw was short or particularly dry.

Before the grain was ready for milling into meal or flour, it had to be threshed out from the straw. This was done by setting up the sheaves on a barn floor, tops up, and threshing out the grain with flails swung rhythmatically by a crew of six or eight men. When the grain had been pounded off the straw forks were used to shake out the grain and throw the straw aside. Before the fanning mill came into use about 1825, barn doors were opened on a windy day and the grain was tossed into the air to permit the chaff to be blown out. In early days this grain was frequently pounded into a coarse flour in a hollowedout stump by a pestle, or carried long distances to a waterpowered gristmill.

All the early tools were primitive: few were brought in with the migrating pioneers and those made were largely of wood fabrication. Hay forks were fashioned from tree branches, grain scoops were gouged out of blocks of wood; hoes, metal
