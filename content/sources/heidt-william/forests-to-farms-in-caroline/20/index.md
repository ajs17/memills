fulltext:lowed in 1808. John James Speed had been a merchant in Virginia and, with his brother, opened a store in 1805 in a log house just east of Slaterville. The next year he succeeded in having a postoffice established there and he became postmaster of Speedsville. Later he removed to Ithaca, then to Cortland, and died in Maine in 1860.

At Speedsville, the site of the oldest house is marked. It was built by Laban Jenks in 1819 and later known as the Legg Homestead. This marker points out also location of Speedsville Commons, land for which was donated by Leonard Legg and John Stearns. It was incorporated in 1858 as a state park. At one time Jenks owned 400 acres of land around Jenksville, but he moved to Michigan in 1825.

Eventually the postoffice was removed to Jenksville but the name of Speedsville was continued upon the insistence of John J. Speed, Jr., who became postmaster in 1832. He was elected to the assembly in that year and was a presidential elector in 1840. Subsequently, he engaged in the mercantile business in Ithaca, but lost heavily in the failure of the Fall Creek Woolen Mills. After that, he was associated with Ezra Cornell in development of the telegraph, retrieved his fortune and paid his creditors.

On Route 79, just east of Slaterville, a marker indicates the site of a blockhouse built of squared logs in 1806 by John James Speed and used as a postoffice. It was on the route of the Catskill Turnpike.
