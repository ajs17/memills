fulltext:Roads throughout the town were still primitive dirt roads, and would remain so for nearly a century; but the Catskill turnpike, built through in 1805, and the Ithaca-Owego turnpike, completed in 1812, afforded outlets to the country’s eastern markets. Over these two roads went produce of the town to the thriving markets along the Atlantic seaboard—and the world —by way of the Susquehanna and Hudson Rivers, Erie Canal and Cayuga Lake. And over these same routes came the produce of early factories that released the farm family from the restrictive economy of his pioneering days, imports that added greatly to his crop productiveness and to his social and cultural advancement. The days of gracious living were at hand.

The 1835 State census indicated how thriving the town was a generation after the coming of Captain Rich and the Earsley family to the wilderness that was Caroline. The population had reached 2,581; there were recorded that year 70 births, 15 marriages and 34 deaths. Of the town’s 30,323 acres, 12,473 had been improved. There were 3,090 head of cattle, including oxen; 741 horses, 8,847 sheep, 2,246 hogs. The soil was yet rich and free of many infestations, yield was high and transportation by road, lake and canal carried the produce to expanding city markets.

In the homes there were produced 3,960 yards of fulling cloth, 6,244 yards of woolen and 6,190 yards of cotton and linen fabrics. Four gristmills had sales of $22,625; 10 sawmills, $15,334; 1 fulling mill, $2,250; 1 woolen mill, $700 (it produced 700 yards) ; 1 distillery, $6,720; 5 tanneries, $2,450.

The small number of horses, the large number of sheep and the quantities of home-produced fabrics in comparison with that of the woolen mill indicate that the pioneer era had not wholly passed in Caroline. To be especially noticed, too, is the small production of the five tanneries—only a dollar’s worth for each inhabitant of the town—which would seem no more than that required by home consumption. Note, too, that production of yard goods averaged less than seven yards per person, which meant little or none for export.
