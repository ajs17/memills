Potatoes were a year-around staple article of food. Grown plentifully in the new soil, cultivation and harvest required a minimum expenditure of time and labor; preserved easily in outdoor cellars, they kept well. A favorite method of cooking was to cover them in the ashes of the fireplace and roast them.

Wheat was a salable grain, both for flour and distilling, so it was less eaten than rye and corn. Rye bread remained a staple in the rural dietary until comparatively late in the nineteenth century. Corn meal was made into Johnnycake and mush; mush-and-milk was not uncommon in the farm family’s diet, and when other foods were in short supply, it was the mainstay. Milk was another food product for which there were no facilities for marketing except as butter in limited production; so it became an important article of food. Besides providing butter and cheese for home consumption, it entered widely into the preparation of other foods.

Meat was plentiful in the early days, for bears and deer abounded in the county. Venison was served as fresh meat and dried or smoked; bear meat was treated in a like manner. Hogs and sheep supplied meat from the farm. Pork, the leading American meat diet until superseded by beef in the 1880’s was processed into several palatable forms, varying from sausage, headcheese, smoked hams and bacon to salted pork. Lard was an important byproduct of hogs that fattened on nuts of the woodland. It was used extensively in cooking and in the lard lamps that furnished illumination in the winter darkness of the cabin. Lard lamps are found in the DeWitt Museum collection. Bear and raccoon fat were substitutes for lard, and both were preferred in frying doughnuts. Fish is still another food item
