fulltext:Portuguese Shanghaied Caroline Sailor

A Caroline native, who spent four years as a sailor, boasted the unusual experience of having been pressed into the army of Portugal. To obtain his release, service of the American consul were required.

He was Henry Stewart. Born in Caroline in 1817, he remained at home until he was 19, when he went to sea. During time spent in Portugal he learned the language, then traveled in Europe and Africa before returning to his native land. After his return he was employed by Joseph Esty, tanner, for 20 years, then he engaged in manufacture of cement and tile until 1890, when he retired from active business. He died September 25, 1895, at his home 114 East Buffalo Street.

The building, dating back to a tavern on the Catskill turnpike, burned December 23, 1895.

Another health resort at Slaterville was the Fountain House, erected in 1872, later greatly enlarged and made three stories high. About 1891 _W. J. Carns purchased it and popularized it as a sanitorium. On the afternoon of Deeemb√©r-22,-494, the
