Pioneer Era Ends

Caroline’s pioneering era may be said to have largley ended by 1830, with a busy agricultural era following. The date is arbitrary since the change was gradual, but it closely approximates the time when manufactured articles and farming machines began to appear. It was a time when numerous tools, articles of furniture and fabrics were available and when it was no longer necessary for the farming community to produce essential wares in its own primitive shops. Thus freed, the farmer had more time to devote to agricultural productions.
