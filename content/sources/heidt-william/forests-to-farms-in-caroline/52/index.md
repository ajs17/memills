The bridge was 60 feet long and 14 wide, and substantially built of large, hewn timbers and heavy planks. The trusses were fastened to the sills with bolts that were both large and long. Reason for covering the bridge was to protect timbers and planks from the weather that caused rotting. During winters snow was shoveled inside so teams hauling heavy loads would not get stuck on the dry plank flooring.

Inside walls of the bridge made good locations for large and colorful posters advertising circuses. These walls were covered year around with gaudy show bills publicizing acts, or spavin cures, liniments, seeds and other commodities having an appeal to farmers. Local auctions, too, contributed their share of the paper work.

A feature of the bridge was an opening on the upstream side out of which boys fished. On occasion they raised a floor plank, lay on their stomachs and dipped their lines into the water below. When a team was observed approaching, the youthful fishermen scrambled to replace the plank.

Hunt Drove Wolves Over Border

By Burnett C. Rawley, Richford Folklorist

In 1828, wolves in the area became so numerous that the towns of Richford, Berkshire, Candor and Lisle held a conference at which it was resolved to appoint two men from each town to organize and conduct a great drive to force the animals out of the country. As plans progressed, many other men and boys joined the drive.

The outfit for each of these participants was made up of a gun, dog and a cowbell. At night sentinels stood guard, ringing bells and firing guns occasionally so the wolves would not run back past the line of the drivers.
