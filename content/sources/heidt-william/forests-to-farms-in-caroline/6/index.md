fulltext:INTRODUCTION

Lying in the southeast part of Tompkins County is the rural town of Caroline; an upland area of high, rounded hills and pleasant valleys running in many directions.

In earlier years the town’s forest trails had been trodden for centuries by the Indian. One of the seventeen important Indian trails of the State was the Warrior’s Trail, which crossed Six Mile Creek west of Brooktondale, at the Beaverbrook Road. This crossing was just six miles from Ithaca which fact gave the stream its present name; much easier to pronounce than its Cayuga name, Teegastoweas.

Unknown traders, French, English and Dutch, from their settlements in the New World, found their way into this region in the late 1600’s and frequently after 1700. Five noted men of colonial times left a record of their journey through the present hamlet of Caroline in 1743.

Following the Revoluntionary War, the vast territory formerly in the possession of the New York State Iroquois Indian tribes, was surveyed and opened to settlers. By 1795, the present town of Caroline was surveyed into farm plots. The sound of the axe and falling timber was heard as adventurous men and women, eager to carve out a homesite for themselves, accepted the challenge of hard pioneer living.

How they subdued a forested wilderness, built their log cabins, cleared the land with primitive tools, and were a selfsufficient people, is aptly told by the author, William Heidt, Jr. In his historical sketches of Caroline he has drawn upon his own experiences as a boy, growing up on a farm is Sullivan County. It was a period when farming and rural life were emerging from time-worn methods into a mechanical age. His portrayal of pioneer life reflects the firsthand know]ledge of the hardships our forbears endured to make a living.
