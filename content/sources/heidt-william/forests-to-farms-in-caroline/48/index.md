Town Lays Out Roads Early

Newcomers into the county traveled over roads that were little more than trails. In fact, the original paths followed Indian paths that had been “brushed out” two feet wide to form a bridle path for those who traveled on foot or horseback. For teams the width was 32 feet. Passage was slow and difficult; from these roads to the settler’s claim there were nothing but blazed paths, and blazed trees marked the boundaries of his claim.

Transportation was a problem in the newly settled Town of Caroline, and the building of roads went on along with clearing of land. Of course, the roads were little more than paths two rods wide cut through the forests; ultimately, they were muddy in the spring and fall, dusty during the summer, and snow-filled in winter.

Commissioners of highways had charge of laying out roads and altering them. The first action by these commissioners entered in the town clerk’s record follows:

Norton’s, between him and Nathaniel Tobey, and runs south 2 degrees 0 minutes west 20 chains 75 links to an ironwood stake, south 56 degrees 30 minutes west 20 chains; south 24 degrees 0 minutes west 65 chains 25 links to intersect the highway leading from John J. Speed’s old place to Charles Manning’s.

“Abiather G. Rounseville, surveyor; John Robison, Moses Read, Commissioners of Highways. March 29, 1811.”

There seems to be an error in the dates, as the first refers to the “fall of 1811” and the date of the recording is March 29, 1811. The latter date would appear to be correct as the next
