Pioneers Worked with Simple Tools (With thanks to Will Osborn)

For fitting timber in building construction, there were broadaxes, chisels, augers, mauls, froes, drawshaves as well as other hand tools. Sawmills operated up-and-down saws until the coming of circular saws and steam power by the mid-1800's.

Until after the Civil War, when “balloon” construction became commonplace because of the availability of sawn lumber, framed buildings prevailed. So-called “country carpenters” needed no blueprints.

To begin construction of a framed building, a log of proper length was placed upon a skid; then a man standing upon this log scored four sides with ax strokes about every four or five inches. It was really remarkable how even this line of strokes was though the distance between them was gauged by his eye.

After the log was scored, along came the hewer, a man equipped with a broadax who smoothed the sides of the log. This ax had a head mounted at a slight right angle to the handle and a cutting edge of twelve or fourteen inches wide. When his work was done, a four-square timber was ready for framing.

On both ends of a crossbeam tenons were cut with a saw and then fitted with a hand chisel. In a corresponding position on both ends of side beams, mortises were cut by first boring large auger holes in a row and then chiselling out the wood. Both mortise and tenon had to be accurately cut as the tenon must fit squarely into the mortise.

Thus the four sills were fitted together, then two-inch auger holes were bored clear through sill and tenon and two roughly rounded hardwood pins were inserted and driven home. Under
