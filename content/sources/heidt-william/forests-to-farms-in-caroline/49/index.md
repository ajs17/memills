fulltext:entry immediately following is dated April 27, 1811. It would appear the road in question had been laid out but not surveyed prior to the fall of 1811.

As entered in the first book of town records, surveys and alterations of highways were continuing in 1825. By that time there were some 47 roads in the young town, and these were assigned to road districts in charge of pathmasters. It was the duty of these officials to keep the roads in repair, and each spring they called out the property owners to do “road work” with men and teams.

Some of the names of roads listed in the early records are: Level Green, Hagin, Speed, Quick, Dryden, Heart (Hart), Jersey, Leggett, Schoonmaker, Rawson, Blair, Wiltsie, Bridge, Boyer, Rich, Jewitt, Cass. It will be noticed that for the most part these roads were named for early settlers who lived along them. However, there is one private road recorded.

Catskill Turnpike Main Route

As early as 1747 a tote road began developing westward from Catskill on the Hudson to supply the country lying between that river and the Susquehanna. In 1790, the state took control and developed the Catskill turnpike. Rebuilt to a 25foot width and given a stone and gravel surface, it become the leading route from the East after its completion in 1805.

The route and time made on it are indicated by an advertisement appearing in an Ithaca Journal of 1823. It reads:

“This coach leaves Ithaca for Catskill every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 2 p.m. and arrives at Catskill the next day in time for the 5 o’clock boats to New York; passing each day through Caroline, Richford, Lisle, Greene, Stamford and Cairo; and via. Bainbridge, Unadilla, Franklin, Delhi, Bloomville, Prattsville and Windham every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.”
