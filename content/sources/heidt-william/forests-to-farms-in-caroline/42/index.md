Fitting the soil on newly cleared land was a difficult task, what with stumps and roots still strongly entrenched and only improvised implements to break the soil and prepare a seed bed. For a plow a crotched limb was used to stir the recently burned-over earth to a depth of a few inches, over which grain seeds were broadcast and then “brushed-in” with a leafless branch of a tree that was hauled by hand or by an ox team. Later a pegtooth harrow replaced the brush when stumps had been cleared off. It had wooden teeth that faced to the rear so it would slide over rather than become entangled in roots that had not disappeared. Potatoes, corn and similar garden seeds were deposited in holes made by a pointed stick.

By 1830, numerous machines and implements became available to farmers at about the time when their fields had first become clear of obstructions and could be worked by these time-and-work-saving machines. Among this equipment were reversible plows, cultivators, spring-tooth harrows, mowers, reapers, seeders and small tools. Metal sap spiles replaced those whittled from sumac of a winter’s evening, and tin buckets took the place of wooden ones while evaporators superseded the uneconomical caldron for boiling sap.

Wastage of the timber wealth of the country was heavy while clearing of the land was under way. This was especially true of the hardwoods which were burned for ashes and charcoal. Pines and hemlocks were used in erecting buildings and fences of rails; basswood, ash and chestnuts also split into rails. Many thousand trees were thus converted into usefulness since twenty-one rails were required for two rods of fencing.

With the coming of sawmills, considerable lumber was produced by the many small mills. This lumber was hauled to the growing villages and to the lakeside for shipment on the canal. But millions of board feet of prime hemlock were later left to rot where the trees had been fellen by the barkpeelers.
