Surveyed in 1789-90 under the direction of Simeon DeWitt, surveyor general of New York State, the territory was divided into 28 townships. Each was as nearly 10 miles square as it was possible to make them and each contained 100 great lots of 600 acres each. The Land Office Commissioners began making allotments in 1790, with the requirement that actual settlement was to be made within seven years after January 1, 1790.

While hundreds of the war veterans claimed land, millions of acres outside the bounty lands were sold by the New York State Land Office to speculators who, in turn, sold them to settlers. One such area that embraced the three southern towns of Tompkins County was the Watkins and Flint Tract. This tract was roughly 15 miles wide and 35 miles long and contained 363,000 acres. It was to be paid for to the State at the rate of three shillings and four pence per acre.

The tract derives its name from John W. Watkins, a New York lawyer, and Royal W. Flint, who were the leaders of a group of associates in the plan. The patent was granted them June 25, 1794, after a survey of the area had been made. Although Watkins soon transferred his interests in the tract to his associates, land titles of today are traced back to the original Watkins and Flint purchase.

At the time there were two brothers in Stratford, Connecticut, who became interested in these lands. They were Robert C. and Samuel W. Johnson, sons of William S. Johnson, second president of Kingâ€™s College in New York City (now Columbia University) and grandsons of Samuel Johnson, its first president. They acquired a large portion of the area embraced by the present towns of Caroline, Danby and Newfield, and the area became known as the Johnson Lands.

In 1795 Robert C. Johnson acquired unsold lands in the tract and later made extensive purchases in the Ohio Reserve. Defaulting in his payments in 1800, he assigned his New York holdings to Connecticut to save his underwriters from loss.Connecticut took title to 16,000 acres, which included Connecticut Hill, sold the lands and diverted proceeds to state school funds.
