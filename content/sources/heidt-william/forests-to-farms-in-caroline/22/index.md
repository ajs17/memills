fulltext:In The American Journal, an Ithaca weekly newspaper, of March 5, 1823, appears the following notice:

LOST, on Saturday 22d ult. between J. Grant’s Coffee House and the Town of Caroline, a Red Morocco POCKET-BOOK containing one $3 bill, one note of hand for twenty-three dollars, signed by Moses Hemingway, a note for nine dollars, signed by David Kingman, and my emancipation from J. J. Speed, together with some other papers of no use to any person but the owner. Whoever will return Said Pocket Book with the papers to Mr. Grant, at Ithaca, shall be generously rewarded.

PETER WEBB, Ithaca, March 3, 1823.

Owners Record Slave Boy’s Birth

An entry in the town clerk’s record of January 8, 1812, reads: “Charles, born April 25, 1812, son of Catharine and slave to Catharine Depey, wid. Recorded Jan. 8, 1812.”

Since the recording is earlier than the birth date, it is apparent that an error was made in the birth date. Presumably, the slave boy was born in 1811.

On August 16, 1822, Augustine Boyer recorded the birth of another slave boy by making an affidavit that was duly recorded by the town clerk. The Christian name cannot be read on the faded page, but his surname was Andrews. His mother was a slave at the time of his birth, August 17, 1821, and owned by Boyer.

On February 18, 1813, the Caroline town clerk recorded the following births of white children. Varanes Rhoode, August 21, 1804; Increase Summer Rhoode, October 3, 1805; Alexis Blanford Rhoode, September 19, 1807; Sarepta Caroline Rhoode, April 19, 1810.

Seven years later, in March 1820, Jonas Rhoode and Abigail Rhoode requested the information be recorded that they were the parents of these children “as doubts may arise as to who are the parents. I do hereby insert the names of the parents, Jonas and Abigail Rhoode. John Cantine, T. Clerk.”
