fulltext:a note in his journal concerning methods employed to remove hemlocks.

“Some of the new settlers clear the lands by beginning at tops of trees and cutting limbs. The upper ones break off the lower, and they soon strip the loftiest hemlock. We saw some of the trees trimmed that way. Others prefer making roads where the trees have been cut down, so that they can root them up. The weight of the trees in falling will remove the roots, which cannot be got rid of in cutting.”

First Year’s Balance $18.99

For the first year of Caroline’s township affairs, Supervisor William Rounseville’s account was audited as follows:

Approved this 29th day of August, 1812 Levi Slater, T. Clerk E. Chambers, J. Peace

It seems someone made an error in his addition, as the three expenditures total $147.02.

For 1813 the town did not do quite as well insofar as a balance was concerned. There was only $5.42 carried over, but next year there was no balance in spite of the fact that the total tax had risen from $66.43 the year before to $126.40.

In 1820, the state tax was $110.93; county tax, $59.28; and the total town expenses $348.59. This year the town had a bad debt of 19 cents and closed the year owing the supervisor $3.19.
