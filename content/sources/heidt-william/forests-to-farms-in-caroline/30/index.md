Paying for Land Difficult

After only 175 years, it can scarcely be imagined how difficult it was for farmers to pay for their lands. Most of the settlers who came into Caroline—or into the county, for that matter—were men of small means; their chief assets were determination and ability to work hard and long under adverse conditions.

One of the most detailed accounts of these struggles in Caroline is that of Henry Quick and his father, Philip Quick. The latter came from Ulster County in 1800 and worked for General Cantine, but when the General’s business failed, his employee lost most of his wages. At $6 an acre, Philip Quick then purchased a farm that was solid woodland. Working for Abram Chambers two days a week to pay his board, he spent the other four—and part of each night—clearing his land. He taught school during the winter and worked on the farm in the summer before he married Sally, a daughter of the Widow Earsley. Pe died of consumption at the age of 31.

Their son Henry lived with his grandfather after his father’s death until he was 17, when he struck out for himself. Soon taken ill, it was three years before he recovered. Then he commenced working on a farm at $120 a year for the first two years, then $140 for two years. When he became 21, he received his father’s estate—nine acres of land and $40.

This inheritance plus his savings enabled him to purchase a farm of 60 acres. He married in 1854, when he was 24, and after he and his wife had worked a year for wages, they began farming their own acres. To buy the land and necessary equipment, they went $800 in debt. By dint of hard work and frugal living, they cleared 92 acres of barren lands and converted them into a debt-free, productive farm.
