Courtesy of Charles C. Vorhis H"OODEN TRESTLE OVER SIX MILE CREEK Erected in 1874 to carry the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad over the Brooktondale gorge, it was constructed of foot-square timbers supplied by neighboring forests. Its efficiency as a windbreak was not fully appreciated wntil the closely spaced timbers were replaced by a spidery steel trestle in 1894. At that time, trains did not run on Sunday, a circumstance greatly favoring Moses Hurlburt who had the contract for removing the wooden trestle. During the week he prepared a section for removal on Sunday for replacement by steel work. Immengity of the original structure is indicated by the 800-foot length and 85-foot height of the new trestle. In 1884, the line reorganized the Elmira, Cortland & Northern, and in 1905 the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company became owner of the property. Thirty years later the Lehigh abandoned service on the 25.5-mile stretch between Van Etten and Ithaca, and carly in 1936 the Beth Iehem Steel Company demolished the stcel trestle.
