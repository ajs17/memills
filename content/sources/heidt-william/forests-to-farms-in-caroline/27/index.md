fulltext:stress of wind, pine sills and beams might give but oak pins held and the structure remained firm and true for many years.

These pins were made of oak or other hardwood, a block of which was stood on end and with a froe split into desired thickness for pin making. This was called “riving” and the pieces split off were known as “shakes.” Shakes were split into rough plugs that were somewhat rounded and pointed with a hand ax, and then driven into the auger holes with a large, wooden mallet or maul.

The froe was a cleaving tool made by a local blacksmith. It had an iron blade, thicker on the top and beveled to a splitting edge; a wooden handle stood straight up. An operator grasped this handle, placed the blade upon the block to be rived, and then with a mallet struck the back of the froe with heavy blows. Froes were used in this manner in making early-day barrel staves, and shingles until well after the beginning of the twentieth century.

In the usual building, barn or dwelling, there were four

“bents,” as the framed cross units were called. One bent formed the skeleton for each end, and the other two were erected near the center of the building. On a frame for a barn 36 feet long, one of the center bents might be erected 16 feet from the end to provide a hay mow of that width. The other center bent was set up approximately 20 feet from the opposite end bent, this to provide for a barn floor 10 feet in width and a cowstable of the same width. Space over both the barn floor and the stable was used for mows of forage. “These bents were framed on the ground, with the tenons cut on each end of the uprights to fit into the sill or roofplate. The center bents were moved into position and one after another was raised into position by means of pike poles manned by members of a neighborhood “raisin’ bee.” As each bent was raised and tenons fitted into the sill mortises, it was braced. When all four bents were up and securely “stayed,” the rafter plates were raised, fitted and permanently pegged in the same manner as had the other posts.
