They worked with a small beginning; perhaps two or three acres of land were cleared each year. At first this acreage could be expected to produce little more than a subsistence let alone pay taxes, interest on indebtedness and make a token payment on the principle. At the time production was limited by the few cleared acres, prices for their crops were small and transportation difficult.
