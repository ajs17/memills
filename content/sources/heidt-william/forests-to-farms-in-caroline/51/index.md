From DeWitt Museum Collection BIG BRIDGE AT MOTT’S CORNERS

As indicated by the inscription, this drawing was made November 13, 1879, by May H. Tobey. Little other information concerning the artist or bridge has come to light, as no one has been found who remembers the structure and only a few persons have personal recollections of the wielder of the pen. “May” appears to be a nickname as the census of 1850 lists her as Marion H., daughter of Nathaniel M. Tobey (1813-1885) and Esthaer M. Hart (18141868). Born in 1847, Marian Tobey died in 1915. She is remembered by some older residents of Brooktondale as a teacher of painting, vocal and piano music and as instructor in the Congregational (now Federated) Church there.
